1. **Loss of Creative Control and Ownership**: The contract requires John Doe to deliver two complete albums within the three-year term. This may lead to a loss of creative control, as the label may exert pressure to produce commercially successful music, potentially compromising John Doe's artistic vision. Additionally, the contract does not specify ownership of the master recordings, which may be retained by the label, limiting John Doe's ability to control the use and distribution of his music.

2. **Unfair Royalty Rate**: The contract offers John Doe a 12% royalty rate on net sales revenue, which may be considered low compared to industry standards. This could result in John Doe earning significantly less than his peers, potentially impacting his financial stability and ability to sustain a career in the music industry.

3. **Exclusivity and Limited Career Opportunities**: The contract requires John Doe to maintain an exclusive recording relationship with Music Label Records and prohibits him from recording with competing labels. This may limit John Doe's ability to explore other opportunities, collaborate with other artists, or switch labels if he becomes dissatisfied with the current arrangement. This exclusivity clause may also restrict John Doe's ability to pursue other creative projects or ventures outside of music.

4. **Unfavorable Royalty Split**: The artist receives only 12% of net sales revenue, which is a relatively low percentage compared to the label's share. This may result in the artist earning less from their music sales.

5. **Limited Creative Control**: Although not explicitly stated, the contract's requirement for the artist to provide monthly progress updates on recording activities may imply a level of oversight or control by the label. This could limit the artist's creative freedom and autonomy.

**Step 4: Note any termination conditions that affect the duration**

- The contract mentions that either party may terminate with 60 days written notice. This means that the contract can be terminated early, which could affect the duration of the contract.

**Step 1: Identify all monetary commitments, financial penalties, and revenue splits**

- The artist receives 12% of net sales revenue, which is a relatively low royalty rate.
- There are no explicit financial penalties mentioned in the contract.
- The artist must perform at minimum 20 promotional shows per year, which may require significant time and resources, but there's no mention of compensation for these performances.

**Step 2: Look for termination clauses - can the artist exit, what are the conditions?**

- The contract can be terminated by either party with 60 days written notice.
- This is a relatively standard termination clause, but it's essential to note that the artist has some flexibility to exit the contract if needed.

**Step 3: Find any one-sided obligations that favor the label/company**

- The artist must maintain an exclusive recording relationship and shall not record with competing labels. This is a significant obligation that favors the label.
- The artist must provide monthly progress updates on recording activities, which may be time-consuming and could be seen as an obligation that favors the label.
- The artist must perform at minimum 20 promotional shows per year, which may be a significant burden and could be seen as an obligation that favors the label.

**Step 4: Check for creative control limitations or approval requirements**

- There are no explicit limitations on creative control mentioned in the contract.
- However, the requirement for the artist to provide monthly progress updates on recording activities could be seen as an indirect limitation on creative control.

**Step 5: Evaluate liability limitations, indemnifications, and ownership of intellectual property**

- There are no explicit liability limitations or indemnifications mentioned in the contract.
- The contract does not specify ownership of intellectual property, which could lead to disputes in the future.

**Step 6: Note any restrictive clauses (exclusivity, non-compete, ""360 deals"")**

- The artist must maintain an exclusive recording relationship and shall not record with competing labels, which is an exclusivity clause.
- There is no mention of a non-compete clause or a ""360 deal"" (a deal where the label takes a percentage of the artist's touring, merchandise, and other revenue streams).

1. **Creative Control and Exclusive Relationship**: The contract stipulates that the artist must maintain an exclusive recording relationship with Music Label Records, which may limit the artist's creative freedom and ability to collaborate with other labels or artists. This exclusivity clause could potentially stifle the artist's growth and opportunities, as they may be restricted from exploring other projects or partnerships that could benefit their career.

2. **Performance and Delivery Obligations**: The contract requires the artist to deliver two complete albums within the three-year term, with the first album due within 12 months. This can be a significant risk for the artist, as failure to meet these deadlines or deliver albums that meet the label's expectations could result in termination of the contract or legal action. Additionally, the requirement to perform at least 20 promotional shows per year can be physically and mentally demanding, and may interfere with the artist's other commitments or personal life.

3. **Revenue Sharing and Financial Risks**: The contract states that the artist shall receive 12% of net sales revenue, which may not be a favorable royalty rate for the artist. This could result in the artist earning less than they expect or deserve from their work, especially if the label deducts various expenses or fees from the net sales revenue.

* **Lack of Control over Budget and Expenses**: The contract does not specify how the label will budget or allocate expenses for the artist's projects, which could result in the artist having limited control over their own finances or creative decisions.

1. **Looking for words indicating time periods**: The contract mentions ""three (3) years"" as the term of the agreement, indicating a specific duration. Additionally, it mentions ""12 months"" for the delivery of the first album, and ""per year"" for the minimum number of promotional shows.

2. **Identifying the starting point (commencement date)**: The contract states it was entered into on ""January 1, 2024,"" which serves as the effective date or commencement date of the agreement. The term of three years starts from this date.

3. **Looking for renewal or extension clauses**: There are no explicit renewal or extension clauses mentioned in the contract. This means that, as written, the agreement does not automatically renew or extend beyond its initial three-year term without further action by the parties involved.

4. **Noting any termination conditions that affect the duration**: The contract includes a termination clause that allows either party to terminate the agreement with ""60 days written notice."" This means that the actual duration of the contract could be less than three years if either party decides to terminate it. However, there are no conditions that would extend the term beyond three years based on the information provided.

1. **Identify all ""shall"", ""must"", or ""agrees to"" statements concerning the artist:**
   - The artist ""agrees to deliver two complete albums during the term, with the first album due within 12 months.""
   - The artist ""must provide monthly progress updates on recording activities.""
   - The artist ""agrees to maintain an exclusive recording relationship and shall not record with competing labels.""
   - The artist ""must perform at minimum 20 promotional shows per year.""
   - The term ""shall be three (3) years from the effective date"" is more about the contract duration than a direct obligation but implies the artist is committed for this duration.
   - The artist ""shall receive 12% of net sales revenue"" is a benefit rather than an obligation.

2. **Look for delivery requirements (music, content, performances):**
   - Deliver two complete albums within the three-year term, with the first album due within 12 months.
   - Perform at a minimum of 20 promotional shows per year.

3. **Identify any creative restrictions or approval requirements:**
   - The artist must maintain an exclusive recording relationship and shall not record with competing labels. This is a significant creative restriction as it limits the artist's ability to work with other labels during the contract term.
   - There are no explicit approval requirements mentioned for the content of the albums or performances, but the monthly progress updates could imply some level of oversight by the label.

4. **Note any marketing or promotional obligations:**
   - The artist must perform at a minimum of 20 promotional shows per year, which is a direct promotional obligation.
   - Providing monthly progress updates could also be seen as part of promotional or marketing efforts, keeping the label informed about the artist's activities.

5. **Check for any exclusivity clauses or non-compete requirements:**
   - The contract includes an exclusivity clause where the artist agrees to maintain an exclusive recording relationship with Music Label Records and shall not record with competing labels during the term of the agreement.

6. **Finally, summarize all artist obligations:**
   - Deliver two complete albums within the three-year contract term, with the first album due within 12 months.
   - Provide monthly progress updates on recording activities.
   - Maintain an exclusive recording relationship and not record with competing labels.
   - Perform at a minimum of 20 promotional shows per year.

**Step 1: Identify all monetary commitments, financial penalties, and revenue splits**

* The artist is entitled to 12% of net sales revenue, which may be considered a relatively low royalty rate.
* There is no mention of an advance or other forms of monetary commitment from the label.
* The artist is required to deliver two complete albums, which may involve significant financial investment in recording and production costs.
* The artist must perform at least 20 promotional shows per year, which may also involve additional expenses.

**Step 2: Look for termination clauses - can the artist exit, what are the conditions?**

* Either party can terminate the agreement with 60 days' written notice, which provides some flexibility for the artist to exit the contract.
* However, the artist is still obligated to deliver the two complete albums during the term, and termination may not release them from this obligation.

**Step 3: Find any one-sided obligations that favor the label/company**

* The artist is required to provide monthly progress updates on recording activities, which may be seen as an administrative burden.
* The artist must maintain an exclusive recording relationship with the label, which limits their ability to work with other labels or collaborators.
* The label has not committed to any specific level of investment or support for the artist's career, which may create an imbalance in the relationship.

**Step 4: Check for creative control limitations or approval requirements**

* The contract does not explicitly mention creative control or approval requirements, which may suggest that the label has some level of control over the artist's work.
* The artist is required to deliver two complete albums, which may imply that the label has some expectations or requirements for the content and style of the music.

**Step 5: Evaluate liability limitations, indemnifications, and ownership of intellectual property**

* The contract does not mention liability limitations or indemnifications, which may leave the artist exposed to potential risks and liabilities.
* The contract does not explicitly state who owns the intellectual property rights to the artist's work, which may be a significant concern for the artist.

**Step 6: Note any restrictive clauses (exclusivity, non-compete, ""360 deals"")**

* The artist is required to maintain an exclusive recording relationship with the label, which limits their ability to work with other labels or collaborators.
* The contract does not explicitly mention a non-compete clause, but the exclusivity requirement may have a similar effect.
* The contract does not appear to be a ""360 deal,"" which would involve the label having control over multiple aspects of the artist's career, such as touring, merchandising, and endorsements.

1. **Exclusivity and Limited Creative Freedom**: By agreeing to maintain an exclusive recording relationship with Music Label Records, the artist is restricted from recording with other labels. This could limit their creative freedom and opportunities. If the artist is not satisfied with the label's direction or decisions, they may be stuck in a contract that prevents them from exploring other options.

2. **Revenue Uncertainty and Potential Low Earnings**: The artist's revenue is tied to net sales revenue, and they will receive 12% of it. However, the contract does not specify how ""net sales revenue"" is calculated, which could lead to disputes or unexpected deductions. Additionally, if the albums do not perform well commercially, the artist's earnings may be lower than expected.

3. **Termination and Promotional Obligations**: The contract allows either party to terminate with 60 days' written notice. If the label terminates the contract, the artist may be left without a record deal and may not be able to release their music through other channels for a period of time. Furthermore, the artist is required to perform at a minimum of 20 promotional shows per year, which could be physically and financially demanding. If the artist is unable to fulfill these obligations due to illness, injury, or other circumstances, they may be in breach of the contract.

Additional risks that could be considered include:

* **Contract Duration and Renewal**: The contract is for a fixed term of 3 years, and the artist may be required to deliver two complete albums during this time. If the contract is not renewed or if the artist is unable to negotiate a new deal, their career momentum may be disrupted.
* **Governing Law and Jurisdiction**: The contract is governed by the laws of California, which may not be the artist's preferred jurisdiction. This could lead to additional costs and complexities if disputes arise.

1. **Term of the Agreement**: The contract is for 3 years.
   - **Risk**: A lengthy contract term can limit the artist's flexibility and freedom to renegotiate or exit the contract if their career takes off or if they're dissatisfied with the label's performance.

2. **Delivery of Albums**: The artist must deliver two complete albums within the 3-year term, with the first album due within 12 months.
   - **Risk**: The pressure to produce high-quality albums within a tight deadline can be stressful and creatively limiting. Missing the deadline could result in penalties or other contractual consequences, although the contract doesn't specify penalties.

3. **Monthly Progress Updates**: The artist is required to provide monthly updates on recording activities.
   - **Risk**: This level of oversight could be seen as intrusive and might limit the artist's creative freedom. It could also create administrative burdens.

4. **Exclusive Recording Relationship**: The artist cannot record with competing labels.
   - **Risk**: This exclusivity clause restricts the artist's ability to explore other opportunities, potentially limiting their career growth and earnings from other labels or collaborations.

5. **Revenue Share**: The artist receives 12% of net sales revenue.
   - **Risk**: A relatively low percentage of revenue might not be very lucrative for the artist, especially if the label's definition of ""net sales revenue"" deducts a wide range of expenses, further reducing the artist's earnings.

6. **Promotional Shows**: The artist must perform at a minimum of 20 promotional shows per year.
   - **Risk**: This requirement can be physically demanding and may limit the artist's ability to pursue other creative or personal projects. It also doesn't directly generate income unless the shows are paid gigs, and the contract doesn't specify if these shows are paid or not.

7. **Termination Clause**: Either party can terminate with 60 days written notice.
   - **Risk**: While this provides a clear exit strategy, a 60-day notice period can still be challenging for the artist, especially if they're in the middle of a tour, album production, or other commitments. It might also lead to a period of uncertainty before the termination takes effect.

8. **Governing Law**: The agreement is governed by the laws of California.
   - **Risk**: Depending on the artist's location and preferences, being governed by California law might be seen as favorable due to California's robust entertainment law framework. However, it could also mean that any disputes would need to be resolved in California, potentially incurring additional costs and logistical challenges for the artist if they are based elsewhere.

**Summary of Risks**:
- Long-term contract limits flexibility.
- Pressure to deliver albums within a specific timeframe.
- Intrusive oversight through monthly progress updates.
- Exclusive contract limits other opportunities.
- Low revenue share for the artist.
- Mandatory promotional shows can be demanding.
- Termination clause, while available, involves a notice period that could be challenging.
- Potential logistical and financial implications of being governed by California law if the artist is not based there.

4. **Note any termination conditions that affect the duration**:

### 1. Identify all monetary commitments, financial penalties, and revenue splits

- **Monetary Commitments**: The contract doesn't explicitly state any upfront monetary commitments from the artist to the label, such as recording costs or advance repayments. However, it implies that the artist is expected to incur costs associated with recording two albums and performing at least 20 promotional shows per year.
  
- **Financial Penalties**: The contract doesn't directly mention financial penalties. However, failing to deliver albums or not performing the required number of promotional shows could potentially lead to penalties or termination, which might indirectly result in financial losses for the artist.

- **Revenue Splits**: The artist is to receive 12% of net sales revenue. This is a relatively low percentage, indicating that the label takes a significant share (88%) of the net sales revenue. This could be considered a risk if the artist's earnings are heavily dependent on album sales or related revenue.

### 2. Look for termination clauses - can the artist exit, what are the conditions?

- The contract states that ""Either party may terminate with 60 days written notice."" This means the artist has the option to exit the contract by providing 60 days' notice. However, this could be risky if the artist has significant financial or other obligations under the contract that they cannot easily exit without penalty or loss.

### 3. Find any one-sided obligations that favor the label/company

- The artist is required to deliver two complete albums within the term, with the first album due within 12 months, and must provide monthly progress updates. This indicates a significant commitment from the artist.

- The artist must maintain an ""exclusive recording relationship"" and cannot record with competing labels, which heavily favors the label by securing the artist's recording services exclusively.

- The artist is required to perform at a minimum 20 promotional shows per year, which is another significant commitment that favors the label by ensuring promotional activities are carried out.

### 4. Check for creative control limitations or approval requirements

- The contract doesn't explicitly mention creative control or approval requirements for the albums or promotional shows. However, the requirement to ""deliver two complete albums"" implies that the label has some level of approval over the content or quality of the albums, as ""delivery"" typically means acceptance by the label.

### 5. Evaluate liability limitations, indemnifications, and ownership of intellectual property

- The contract doesn't directly address liability limitations, indemnifications, or ownership of intellectual property. These are significant omissions, as they are crucial for understanding the artist's risks and responsibilities, especially regarding potential lawsuits or copyright issues.

### 6. Note any restrictive clauses (exclusivity, non-compete, ""360 deals"")

- **Exclusivity**: The contract includes an exclusivity clause (""Artist agrees to maintain exclusive recording relationship and shall not record with competing labels""), which restricts the artist from recording with other labels.

- **Non-Compete**: While not explicitly labeled as a ""non-compete,"" the exclusivity clause acts similarly by preventing the artist from engaging in recording activities with competitors.

- **""360 Deals""**: The contract doesn't explicitly mention a ""360 deal,"" which typically involves the label receiving a percentage of all the artist's revenue streams (not just album sales). However, the requirement for the artist to perform promotional shows could be seen as part of a broader arrangement that benefits the label beyond just album sales.

### Summary of Risks

1. **Low Revenue Share**: The artist receives only 12% of net sales revenue, which might be considered low.
2. **Exclusivity and Restrictions**: The contract's exclusivity clause restricts the artist's ability to work with other labels.
3. **Significant Commitments**: The artist is required to deliver two albums and perform at least 20 promotional shows per year, which are significant financial and time commitments.
4. **Potential Lack of Creative Control**: While not explicitly stated, the contract implies that the label may have some level of approval over the artist's work.
5. **Omissions on Liability and Intellectual Property**: The contract doesn't address important issues like liability, indemnification, and ownership of intellectual property, which could expose the artist to risks.

Overall, the contract seems to favor the label, with the artist shouldering significant commitments and potentially limited control over their work and earnings.",2.021345615386963,,"{'term': np.float64(0.21), 'delivery_obligation': np.float64(0.23026526896848368), 'reporting_obligation': np.float64(0.30481924121753495), 'exclusivity': np.float64(0.025689152365393587), 'royalty_rate': np.float64(0.33700156746290716), 'performance_obligation': np.float64(0.3227036316008367), 'termination': np.float64(0.2262342307120379)}",0.23667329890388486

Okay, let's see. The user wants me to analyze the artist contract and extract the term or duration of the agreement. They specified to return only the specific term mentioned.

First, I'll read through the contract provided. The key part here is the sentence: ""The term of this agreement shall be three (3) years from the effective date."" That seems straightforward. The effective date is January 1, 2024, so the term is three years from that date. 

I need to make sure there's no other mention of duration elsewhere that might conflict or add more details. Scanning through the rest of the contract, there are other obligations like delivering two albums, monthly updates, exclusivity, etc., but none of those affect the term. The termination clause mentions 60 days notice, but that's about ending the agreement before the term is up, not the term itself. 

So the term is clearly stated as three years. The answer should just be ""three (3) years"" without any extra information. The user wants only the specific term, so I shouldn't include the effective date or any other clauses. Let me double-check to ensure I didn't miss any other mentions of term. Nope, everything else is about obligations during the term or termination. Yep, the correct term is three years.

Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to identify all the key obligations and responsibilities of the artist from the given contract. First, I need to read through the contract carefully to make sure I don't miss any details.

The contract is between Music Label Records and John Doe. The term is three years starting January 1, 2024. The artist has to deliver two complete albums during this period, with the first one due within 12 months. That's a key point. Then there's the monthly progress updates on recording activities. I should note that as a responsibility.

Next, the artist must maintain an exclusive recording relationship, meaning they can't work with competing labels. That's another obligation. The royalty rate is 12% of net sales, but I think that's more about compensation than an obligation. Wait, the user is asking for obligations, so maybe that's not a responsibility. Let me check again. The user wants the artist's obligations, so things the artist has to do. The 12% is a payment term, not an obligation. So maybe I can skip that.

Then there's the requirement to perform at least 20 promotional shows per year. That's definitely an obligation. The termination clause allows either party to terminate with 60 days' notice, but that's a right, not an obligation. The governing law is California, which is a legal clause, not an obligation.

So compiling all the points: deliver two albums (first within 12 months), monthly progress updates, exclusive recording relationship, and perform 20 promotional shows annually. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The contract mentions these four points. The other parts are about term, termination, and governing law, which don't relate to the artist's obligations. 

Wait, the user might be confused if I include the exclusive relationship as an obligation. Yes, the artist is obligated not to record with competitors, so that's a key point. Also, the promotional shows are a clear obligation. The two albums with deadlines are the main deliverables. The monthly updates are part of the process. 

I think that's all. Let me list them as bullet points, making sure each is clear and concise. Avoid any legal jargon but still accurate. Check for any possible missed obligations. The contract doesn't mention other things like image rights or merchandising, so I don't need to include those. The answer should be straightforward with the four points identified.

**Artist Obligations:**  
- Deliver **two complete albums** during the three-year term, with the **first album due within 12 months** of the agreement's effective date.  
- Provide **monthly progress updates** on recording activities.

- Perform a **minimum of 20 promotional shows per year**.  
- Comply with the **60-day written notice requirement** if terminating the agreement (though termination rights apply to both parties).

contract_1,Record Deal,qwen_32b,qwen/qwen3-32b,zero_shot,risks,"<think>
Okay, let's see. The user wants me to identify three key risks for the artist in this record deal contract. Let me start by reading through the contract details carefully.

First, the artist has to deliver two albums in three years, with the first one due in 12 months. That's a tight deadline. If they can't meet that, maybe there's a breach of contract. But the contract doesn't mention penalties for missing deadlines, so maybe the label could terminate the contract or the artist might lose rights? Hmm, not sure yet. Need to check if the termination clause applies here. The termination is with 60 days notice, but if the artist fails to deliver, does the label have grounds for termination without notice? The contract says ""either party may terminate with 60 days written notice,"" so maybe the label can just terminate if the artist doesn't deliver, but the artist might still be liable for not fulfilling the obligation. That's a risk.

Second, the artist has to do 20 promotional shows per year. If they can't meet that, maybe they get penalized or the label can terminate. But again, the contract doesn't specify penalties. So if the artist can't perform due to illness or other reasons, they might face termination or financial loss. That's another risk.

Third, the exclusivity clause. The artist can't record with competing labels. If they want to collaborate with someone else or another label, they can't. This limits their opportunities. If the label isn't promoting the artist well, the artist is stuck. Also, if the label goes under or isn't successful, the artist can't seek help elsewhere. That's a big risk because it restricts their ability to work with others.

Wait, what about the 12% of net sales? Net sales can be tricky because labels often deduct a lot from the net, so the artist might end up with less than expected. But the user asked for three key risks. The first three I thought of are deadlines, promotional obligations, and exclusivity. Maybe the revenue share is a risk too, but the question is about risks that could negatively impact the artist. The 12% might be low, but unless the contract defines net sales clearly, it's a risk. However, the user might be looking for more direct risks like termination or financial penalties. Let me check the contract again. The termination is 60 days notice, so if the artist fails to deliver the albums or do the shows, the label can terminate, but the artist might still have to fulfill the obligations. Also, the exclusivity could prevent the artist from getting better deals elsewhere. So three main risks: 1) Missing deadlines leading to termination or breach, 2) Failing to meet promotional shows leading to termination, 3) Exclusivity preventing other opportunities. Maybe also the revenue share if net sales are calculated in a way that's unfavorable, but the contract states 12% of net sales, so unless there's ambiguity in net sales definition, that's a risk. But the user asked for three, so I'll stick with the first three. Let me make sure each is a distinct risk. Yeah, deadlines, promotional obligations, exclusivity. That's three solid points.
</think>

Here are **three key risks** for the artist (John Doe) in this contract, based on the terms outlined:

---

### **1. Risk of Breach of Contract and Loss of Rights**  
- **Issue**: The artist is obligated to deliver **two complete albums** within three years, with the first due in 12 months. Failure to meet deadlines (e.g., due to creative challenges, health issues, or label delays) could result in a breach of contract.  
- **Impact**: If the artist fails to deliver, the label may terminate the agreement (via the 60-day notice clause) or demand compensation for unmet obligations. Additionally, the artist could lose rights to unreleased recordings or future revenue from the albums.  

---

### **2. Risk of Overexposure and Burnout from Promotional Obligations**  
- **Issue**: The artist must perform **20 promotional shows per year**, which could strain their physical and mental health, especially if the label schedules shows in inconvenient locations or during personal emergencies.  
- **Impact**: Failing to meet this requirement (e.g., due to illness or scheduling conflicts) could lead to termination or financial penalties (even if unspecified in the contract). Overcommitment to promotions might also reduce time for creative work or personal well-being.  

---

### **3. Risk of Restricted Opportunities Due to Exclusivity Clause**  
- **Issue**: The artist is barred from working with **competing labels** during the contract term. This limits their ability to collaborate with other producers, labels, or platforms that could offer better terms or exposure.  
- **Impact**: If the label underperforms (e.g., poor marketing, low sales), the artist is locked into a suboptimal partnership. They cannot seek alternative deals or leverage their work elsewhere, even if the label fails to meet expectations.  

---

### **Additional Considerations**  
- **Revenue Share Ambiguity**: While the artist receives 12% of ""net sales,"" the contract does not define how ""net sales"" are calculated. Labels often deduct costs (e.g., manufacturing, distribution, marketing) aggressively, which could reduce the artist’s actual earnings.  
- **Termination Vulnerability**: Either party can terminate with 60 days’ notice, but the artist has no protections against termination for cause (e.g., label dissatisfaction with performance).  

These risks highlight the importance of negotiating clearer deadlines, defining ""net sales,"" and including clauses for renegotiation or early termination if the label fails to support the artist adequately.",4.385950565338135,,"{'term': np.float64(0.21388754191636183), 'delivery_obligation': np.float64(0.22689381996646718), 'reporting_obligation': np.float64(0.0), 'exclusivity': np.float64(0.013580600350205653), 'royalty_rate': np.float64(0.24680636715223175), 'performance_obligation': np.float64(0.22252927427317107), 'termination': np.float64(0.24466066056789995)}",0.16690832346090537
contract_1,Record Deal,qwen_32b,qwen/qwen3-32b,few_shot,term_extraction,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to analyze the given artist contract and determine the term. Let me start by reading through the contract carefully.

The contract states that the term is three (3) years from the effective date, which is January 1, 2024. So the initial term is clearly 3 years. Now, I need to check if there's any mention of automatic renewal or other conditions that might extend the term beyond the initial period. 

Looking at the contract details: it mentions the artist must deliver two albums, with the first due within 12 months. There's a requirement for monthly progress updates and exclusivity with the label. Also, there's a termination clause allowing either party to terminate with 60 days' written notice. However, the termination clause doesn't mention anything about renewal after the initial term. It just allows termination during the term. 

So, the initial term is 3 years. The contract doesn't specify any automatic renewal beyond that. The termination clause is about ending the agreement before the term ends, not about extending it. Therefore, the term is straightforward here. The key points are the 3-year duration and the possibility of termination with 60 days' notice, but no automatic renewal. 

I should make sure there's no hidden clause or implication that the term renews. The example given in Example 2 had automatic renewal, but this one doesn't. So the answer should be 3 years with the termination clause mentioned. The user probably wants the term summarized, so I'll present it as ""3 years with termination possible upon 60 days written notice.""
</think>

**Term:** 3 years with termination possible upon 60 days written notice  

**Analysis:**  
The contract explicitly states the term is **three (3) years** from the effective date (January 1, 2024). While the agreement includes obligations like delivering two albums, exclusivity, and promotional requirements, there is **no mention of automatic renewal** beyond the initial 3-year term. However, the termination clause allows **either party to terminate the agreement with 60 days’ written notice**, which applies during the term but does not extend or renew it. Thus, the term is fixed at 3 years, with early termination rights.",1.8703408241271973,,"{'term': np.float64(0.3317348841533816), 'delivery_obligation': np.float64(0.24030716458620605), 'reporting_obligation': np.float64(0.0053077438890011585), 'exclusivity': np.float64(0.009285140168703965), 'royalty_rate': np.float64(0.2156103440311273), 'performance_obligation': np.float64(0.21376311570167322), 'termination': np.float64(0.25008008552560446)}",0.1808697825793854
contract_1,Record Deal,qwen_32b,qwen/qwen3-32b,few_shot,obligations,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to analyze the artist contract provided and list the obligations. Let me start by reading through the contract carefully.

First, the contract is between Music Label Records and John Doe, effective January 1, 2024, for three years. The main obligations mentioned are delivering two albums, with the first due in 12 months. Then there's a requirement for monthly progress updates. The artist must maintain an exclusive recording relationship, meaning no other labels. They get 12% of net sales. Also, they have to perform at least 20 promotional shows per year. Termination is possible with 60 days' notice, and the agreement is governed by California law.

Now, the user's examples show that obligations are listed as bullet points, each starting with a hyphen. They extract the key duties from the contract text. So I need to identify each obligation from the given contract and present them similarly.

Let me break down the contract sentence by sentence. The first part is the agreement between the parties and the term. The obligations start with ""Artist agrees to deliver two complete albums..."" So that's one obligation. Then ""Artist must provide monthly progress updates..."" That's another. Next, ""Artist agrees to maintain exclusive recording relationship..."" That's a third. The part about receiving 12% of net sales is a royalty clause, not an obligation, so maybe not included. Then ""Artist must perform at minimum 20 promotional shows per year."" That's a fourth obligation. The termination clause and governing law are legal terms, not obligations of the artist, so they can be excluded.

Wait, the user's examples include obligations that are actions the artist must take. The royalty percentage is a right, not an obligation. Similarly, termination and governing law are legal terms but not obligations the artist has to fulfill. So the obligations here are: deliver two albums (first within 12 months), monthly updates, exclusivity, and 20 promotional shows. Let me check again. The contract says ""Artist agrees to deliver two complete albums during the term, with first album due within 12 months."" So that's two obligations: two albums total, first within a year. Then monthly updates. Exclusivity is another. 20 shows per year. The rest are terms but not obligations. So the obligations list should be four points. Let me make sure I didn't miss any. The user's examples included all the required actions, so I need to follow that. Yes, that's correct. So the final obligations list should be four bullet points as outlined.
</think>

**Obligations:**  
- Deliver two complete albums during the 3-year term (first album due within 12 months)  
- Provide monthly progress updates on recording activities  
- Maintain an exclusive recording relationship (no competing labels)  
- Perform a minimum of 20 promotional shows per year

contract_1,Record Deal,qwen_32b,qwen/qwen3-32b,few_shot,risks,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this contract analysis. First, I need to read through the contract terms carefully. The agreement is between Music Label Records and John Doe, lasting three years. The artist has to deliver two albums, with the first one due in 12 months. They also need to provide monthly updates, maintain exclusivity, receive 12% of net sales, perform 20 promotional shows a year, and either party can terminate with 60 days' notice. The governing law is California.

Starting with the album delivery requirement. Two albums in three years, first one in 12 months. That seems tight. If the artist can't meet the deadline, there might be penalties, but the contract doesn't mention them. So the risk here is the pressure to deliver on time without clear consequences for delays. Maybe the artist could face legal action or loss of rights if they miss the deadline.

Next, the monthly progress updates. That's a lot of administrative work. The artist might feel micromanaged, which could affect creativity. Also, if the label isn't satisfied with the progress, they might push for changes or even terminate the contract, though termination is possible with 60 days' notice. So the risk here is constant oversight and potential loss of creative control.

Exclusive recording relationship. The artist can't work with other labels. This limits their options. If they want to collaborate with another label or explore different opportunities, they can't. That's a big restriction on their career growth and flexibility. They might miss out on better deals or opportunities elsewhere.

Royalty split of 12% seems low. Typically, artists might get higher percentages, but it depends on the industry standards. However, 12% is quite low, which means the label takes a large portion of the revenue. The artist's earnings are significantly reduced, which is a financial risk. They might not make enough to sustain their career or recoup their investments.

20 promotional shows per year. That's a lot of performances. The artist might face burnout from constant touring and promotion. There's also the risk of physical and mental exhaustion, which could affect their health and creativity. Plus, if they can't meet the number of shows, there might be penalties, but the contract doesn't specify, so it's unclear what happens if they fall short.

Termination clause with 60 days' notice. Either party can end the contract with 60 days' notice. That's a double-edged sword. The artist could lose the deal quickly if the label isn't satisfied, and the label could terminate without much cause. The artist might not have enough time to find another label or secure their position elsewhere. It's a risk of instability and lack of long-term security.

Governing law in California. That's a specific jurisdiction. If there's a dispute, it has to be resolved in California courts. If the artist is from another state or country, this could be inconvenient and costly. They might have to travel or hire local legal representation, which adds to their expenses.

Putting it all together, the main risks are the tight deadlines, low royalties, exclusivity restrictions, high promotional demands, and the termination clause. The artist is under a lot of pressure to perform, with limited financial returns and career flexibility. They also face potential instability if the label decides to terminate the contract. The exclusivity clause is particularly restrictive, limiting their ability to explore other opportunities. The monthly updates add to the administrative burden and could lead to creative interference. The 12% royalty split is a significant financial risk, as it leaves most of the revenue to the label. The promotional requirements might lead to burnout and health issues. The termination clause with 60 days' notice is a risk because it's relatively short, making the artist's position in the contract uncertain. The governing law in California could also be a logistical and financial burden if disputes arise. Overall, the contract seems to favor the label heavily, with the artist bearing most of the risks and responsibilities.
</think>

**Risks in the Artist Contract:**

1. **Tight Album Delivery Deadlines**  
   - **Risk:** The first album must be delivered within 12 months, and two albums in three years. This creates significant pressure to produce high-quality work under time constraints, potentially leading to rushed or subpar results.  
   - **Impact:** Missed deadlines could result in penalties (not explicitly stated) or strained relationships with the label, even if delays are due to unforeseen circumstances.

2. **Monthly Progress Updates**  
   - **Risk:** Mandatory monthly reporting may lead to micromanagement, stifling creative freedom and increasing administrative burdens.  
   - **Impact:** The artist could face pressure to conform to the label’s expectations, limiting artistic autonomy and innovation.

3. **Exclusive Recording Relationship**  
   - **Risk:** The exclusivity clause prohibits working with competing labels, restricting the artist’s ability to explore better opportunities or collaborate with other industry players.  
   - **Impact:** Limits career flexibility and potential revenue streams, especially if the label underperforms or the artist’s style evolves.

4. **Unfavorable Royalty Split (12% of Net Sales)**  
   - **Risk:** A 12% royalty rate is exceptionally low, leaving the artist with minimal earnings despite the label’s upfront investment.  
   - **Impact:** Financial strain on the artist, making it difficult to sustain their career or recoup costs (e.g., production, marketing).

5. **High Promotional Demands (20 Shows/Year)**  
   - **Risk:** Performing 20 promotional shows annually may lead to physical and mental burnout, especially if the artist is required to tour extensively.  
   - **Impact:** Health risks, reduced creative output, and potential long-term damage to the artist’s well-being.

6. **Short Termination Notice (60 Days)**  
   - **Risk:** Either party can terminate the contract with 60 days’ notice, creating instability for the artist.  
   - **Impact:** The artist may lose their label partnership abruptly, leaving them without support for album releases or promotions.

7. **Governing Law in California**  
   - **Risk:** Disputes must be resolved in California courts, which could be inconvenient or costly for the artist if they reside elsewhere.  
   - **Impact:** Increased legal expenses and logistical challenges in resolving conflicts.

8. **Lack of Clarity on Penalties for Missed Deadlines**  
   - **Risk:** The contract does not specify consequences for failing to deliver albums on time, leaving the artist vulnerable to arbitrary penalties.  
   - **Impact:** Potential legal disputes or loss of rights if deadlines are missed due to factors beyond the artist’s control.

9. **No Mention of Recoupment or Advances**  
   - **Risk:** The contract does not address whether the label provides advances or how expenses (e.g., production, marketing) are recouped from royalties.  
   - **Impact:** The artist may bear upfront costs without financial support, further reducing their net earnings.

10. **Limited Control Over Creative Direction**  
    - **Risk:** Monthly updates and exclusivity clauses may lead to the label exerting influence over the artist’s creative process.  
    - **Impact:** Compromised artistic identity and reduced ownership of the final product.

**Summary:**  
This contract heavily favors the label, imposing strict deadlines, low royalties, and restrictive exclusivity terms. The artist faces significant financial, creative, and operational risks, with limited safeguards against instability or exploitation. Key areas for negotiation include royalty rates, exclusivity duration, termination terms, and clarity on penalties for missed deadlines.",5.294293165206909,,"{'term': np.float64(0.21514520820817745), 'delivery_obligation': np.float64(0.22576537506227398), 'reporting_obligation': np.float64(0.01287575034500255), 'exclusivity': np.float64(0.014758076439145638), 'royalty_rate': np.float64(0.23781453110150041), 'performance_obligation': np.float64(0.22235359719967468), 'termination': np.float64(0.24487229899191895)}",0.16765497676395621

Okay, let's tackle this contract analysis step by step. First, I need to figure out the term or duration of the agreement. The user mentioned looking for words like ""term"", ""duration"", ""years"", ""months"". Let me scan the contract again.

The contract starts by stating it's a Record Deal Agreement between Music Label Records and John Doe on January 1, 2024. Then it says, ""The term of this agreement shall be three (3) years from the effective date."" So that's a clear term of 3 years starting from the effective date, which is January 1, 2024. That would make the end date December 31, 2026, assuming the term is inclusive of the start date.

Next, the user wants me to identify the starting point. The effective date is given as January 1, 2024, so the term begins on that date.

Now, looking for renewal or extension clauses. The contract doesn't mention anything about renewing the agreement after the initial three years. There's no clause that says if they meet certain conditions, the term can be extended. So, it seems like it's a fixed term without automatic renewal.

Termination conditions: The contract states that either party can terminate with 60 days written notice. That means even before the three years are up, either the label or John Doe can end the agreement by giving 60 days notice. So, the term is three years, but it can be terminated earlier. However, the initial term is still three years from the effective date unless terminated.

Summarizing all that, the term is three years starting January 1, 2024. There's no renewal clause, so it doesn't automatically extend. Termination is possible with 60 days notice, which affects the actual duration if either party decides to end it early. But the original term is three years.
</think>

**Step-by-Step Analysis of the Artist Contract Term/Duration:**

1. **Identify Time Period Words:**  
   The contract explicitly states: *""The term of this agreement shall be three (3) years from the effective date.""* This directly defines the term as **3 years**.

2. **Starting Point (Commencement Date):**  
   The effective date is specified as **January 1, 2024**. The term begins on this date and lasts for 3 years, ending on **December 31, 2026** (assuming no extensions or early termination).

3. **Renewal/Extension Clauses:**  
   There is **no mention of automatic renewal** or extension clauses in the contract. The term is fixed at 3 years unless terminated earlier.

4. **Termination Conditions:**  
   The contract allows **either party to terminate with 60 days’ written notice**. This means the agreement could end earlier than the 3-year term if one party decides to terminate it. However, termination does not extend the term—it shortens it.

5. **Summary of Term Understanding:**  
   - **Initial Term:** 3 years (January 1, 2024, to December 31, 2026).  
   - **Termination:** Either party can end the agreement at any time with 60 days’ notice, potentially shortening the duration.  
   - **No Renewal:** The contract does not include provisions for automatic or conditional renewal beyond the initial 3-year term.  

**Final Answer:**  
The agreement has a **3-year term** starting on January 1, 2024, and ending on December 31, 2026. It can be terminated earlier by either party with 60 days’ notice, but there are no clauses for automatic renewal or extension.",1.9524211883544922,,"{'term': np.float64(0.34279444578102497), 'delivery_obligation': np.float64(0.017930133748356728), 'reporting_obligation': np.float64(0.0), 'exclusivity': np.float64(0.004885942585264792), 'royalty_rate': np.float64(0.008142143758973581), 'performance_obligation': np.float64(0.21275460635187468), 'termination': np.float64(0.257682350575104)}",0.1205985175429427

Okay, let's tackle this contract analysis step by step. The user wants me to identify all the artist's obligations based on the given contract. Let me start by breaking down each part of the contract as outlined in the instructions.

First, the user mentioned looking for ""shall"", ""must"", or ""agrees to"" statements. Let me go through the contract text again. The first sentence is about the agreement between the label and the artist. Then, the term is three years. The next part says, ""Artist agrees to deliver two complete albums during the term, with first album due within 12 months."" So that's an ""agrees to"" statement. Then, ""Artist must provide monthly progress updates on recording activities."" That's a ""must"" statement. Next, ""Artist agrees to maintain exclusive recording relationship and shall not record with competing labels."" Here, ""agrees to"" and ""shall not"" are both obligations. Then, ""Artist must perform at minimum 20 promotional shows per year."" Another ""must"" statement. The rest of the contract talks about revenue share, termination, and governing law, which don't seem to be obligations for the artist.

Moving on to delivery requirements. The artist has to deliver two complete albums, with the first one due in 12 months. Also, monthly progress updates are required. So those are the delivery obligations.

Creative restrictions or approval requirements? The contract mentions an exclusive recording relationship, meaning the artist can't work with other labels. That's an exclusivity clause, which is a type of restriction. But are there any other creative restrictions? The contract doesn't mention anything about the content of the music needing approval or specific creative directions, so maybe that's just the exclusivity part.

Marketing or promotional obligations: The artist must perform at least 20 promotional shows per year. That's a clear promotional obligation.

Exclusivity clauses or non-compete requirements: The artist agrees to maintain an exclusive recording relationship and shall not record with competing labels. That's an exclusivity clause. There's no mention of non-compete beyond the recording relationship, so maybe that's the main exclusivity part.

Now, summarizing all these points. Let me make sure I didn't miss any obligations. The artist has to deliver two albums, first in 12 months, monthly updates, 20 promotional shows, and maintain exclusivity. The other parts like revenue share and termination don't impose obligations on the artist. So the summary should list all these points clearly.

### Key Takeaways  
The contract imposes strict delivery timelines, exclusivity, and promotional obligations on the artist. While there are no explicit creative restrictions (e.g., content approval), the exclusivity clause significantly limits the artist’s ability to work with other labels. The artist must prioritize fulfilling album deadlines, maintaining communication through progress reports, and meeting promotional quotas.",3.8072454929351807,,"{'term': np.float64(0.30525602131653545), 'delivery_obligation': np.float64(0.25896374720865994), 'reporting_obligation': np.float64(0.3277115461347497), 'exclusivity': np.float64(0.05197488422506517), 'royalty_rate': np.float64(0.23008260507612216), 'performance_obligation': np.float64(0.3423120722710048), 'termination': np.float64(0.008510959878151793)}",0.21783026230146987

Okay, let's start analyzing this contract step by step as per the user's request. First, I need to break down each part of the contract and check for potential risks for the artist, John Doe.

Starting with the monetary commitments and revenue splits. The contract states that John will receive 12% of net sales revenue. I should consider what ""net sales"" typically means. Usually, net sales are calculated after deducting various costs like manufacturing, distribution, marketing, etc. So, the artist's share might be lower than expected. Also, the contract mentions he has to deliver two albums in three years. If he fails to meet the deadlines, there might be penalties, but the contract doesn't specify any financial penalties for missing deadlines. However, the termination clause allows termination with 60 days notice, which might not be a financial penalty but could affect his career if the label terminates early.

Next, termination clauses. The contract says either party can terminate with 60 days written notice. That seems balanced, but I need to check if there are any conditions. The artist has to perform 20 promotional shows per year. If he fails to do that, does the label have grounds to terminate? The contract doesn't mention penalties for not meeting promotional obligations, just the termination right. So, the artist could be forced to leave without cause, which is a risk. Also, the exclusivity clause might tie him down even if the label isn't performing well.

Looking for one-sided obligations. The artist has to maintain an exclusive relationship, which is common but could be restrictive. He can't work with competitors. Also, the requirement to perform 20 promotional shows per year is a significant obligation. If the label isn't supporting the album, he might have to do all the promotion himself. The contract doesn't mention if the label has any obligations to promote the artist, which is a one-sided risk.

Creative control limitations. The contract doesn't explicitly mention creative control, but the requirement to provide monthly progress updates might imply that the label has some oversight. However, without specific clauses about approval rights, maybe the artist still has creative freedom. But the absence of a clause about creative control could mean the label can reject the work, leading to potential conflicts.

Liability and IP ownership. The contract doesn't specify who owns the intellectual property. Typically, in record deals, the label owns the master recordings, but the artist might retain publishing rights. If it's not stated, there's ambiguity. Also, indemnification clauses are missing. If there's a lawsuit over the artist's work, who covers the costs? The lack of clear indemnification could leave the artist liable.

Restrictive clauses: The exclusivity is a big one. He can't record with competitors, which limits his options. The non-compete isn't explicitly mentioned, but the exclusivity serves a similar purpose. Also, the ""360 deal"" isn't mentioned here, so maybe the label isn't taking a cut from other revenue streams like merch or touring. But the contract doesn't mention other revenue splits beyond net sales, so the artist might not get a share of sync licenses or other income sources.

Putting it all together, the main risks are the low royalty rate (12% of net sales), the exclusivity and promotional obligations without reciprocal label obligations, lack of clear IP ownership, and the possibility of termination without cause. The artist might be overburdened with promotional duties without adequate support from the label. Also, the absence of financial penalties for missing album deadlines could lead to the artist being held to strict deadlines without consequences for the label if they don't support the project.

### **Step-by-Step Analysis of Risks in the Artist Contract**

---

#### **1. Monetary Commitments, Financial Penalties, and Revenue Splits**  
- **Revenue Split**:  
  - The artist receives **12% of net sales revenue**.  
  - **Risk**: ""Net sales"" is ambiguous. Typically, net sales are calculated after deducting costs like manufacturing, distribution, marketing, and returns. This could significantly reduce the artist’s share.  
  - **No financial penalties** are specified for missing deadlines (e.g., delivering albums late), but the label can terminate the contract unilaterally.  

- **Album Obligations**:  
  - The artist must deliver **two albums** within three years, with the first due in 12 months.  
  - **Risk**: No financial penalties for the label if they fail to support the artist (e.g., by not providing studio time or marketing).  

---

#### **2. Termination Clauses**  
- **Termination Rights**:  
  - Either party can terminate with **60 days’ written notice**.  
  - **Risk**: The artist has no protection against termination without cause (e.g., if the label underperforms or breaches obligations).  
  - **No exit incentives** (e.g., buyout clauses) are mentioned, leaving the artist vulnerable to abrupt termination.  

---

#### **3. One-Sided Obligations Favoring the Label**  
- **Exclusivity Clause**:  
  - The artist must maintain an **exclusive recording relationship** with the label.  
  - **Risk**: The artist cannot work with competing labels or monetize other opportunities (e.g., sync licensing, collaborations) unless explicitly allowed.  

- **Promotional Obligations**:  
  - The artist must perform **20 promotional shows per year**.  
  - **Risk**: No reciprocal obligations for the label to promote the artist (e.g., marketing, distribution). The artist bears the burden of promotion without guaranteed support.  

- **Monthly Progress Updates**:  
  - The artist must provide **monthly updates** on recording activities.  
  - **Risk**: This could enable the label to micromanage the creative process or delay releases under the guise of ""monitoring progress.""  

---

#### **4. Creative Control Limitations**  
- **No Explicit Creative Rights**:  
  - The contract does not specify whether the artist retains creative control (e.g., song selection, production, or album artwork).  
  - **Risk**: The label could reject the artist’s work or demand changes without justification, stifling creative freedom.  

---

#### **5. Liability, Indemnification, and IP Ownership**  
- **IP Ownership**:  
  - The contract does **not clarify ownership** of intellectual property (e.g., master recordings, publishing rights).  
  - **Risk**: By default, the label may claim ownership of masters, leaving the artist with no long-term rights to their work.  

- **Liability and Indemnification**:  
  - No indemnification clauses are included.  
  - **Risk**: The artist could be held liable for lawsuits (e.g., copyright infringement, defamation) related to their work, with no financial protection from the label.  

---

#### **6. Restrictive Clauses**  
- **Exclusivity**:  
  - The artist is barred from working with competing labels.  
  - **Risk**: Limits the artist’s ability to negotiate better terms or diversify income streams.  

- **Non-Compete Implications**:  
  - While not explicitly a non-compete clause, the exclusivity requirement effectively restricts the artist from pursuing opportunities with other labels.  

- **No 360 Deal Provisions**:  
  - The contract focuses only on **net sales revenue** (12%) and does not mention splits for other income streams (e.g., touring, merch, sync licensing).  
  - **Risk**: The label could exploit the artist’s broader career (e.g., touring) without sharing profits.

| **Risk Category**               | **Specific Risks**                                                                 |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Financial**                    | Low royalty rate (12% of net sales), ambiguous net sales definition.              |
| **Termination**                  | Unilateral termination rights for the label, no exit incentives for the artist.   |
| **Obligations**                | Exclusivity, promotional duties, and album deadlines without reciprocal support.  |
| **Creative Control**            | No guarantees of creative freedom; label could reject or alter the artist’s work.   |
| **IP and Liability**            | Unclear IP ownership, no indemnification for legal disputes.                    |
| **Restrictive Clauses**          | Exclusivity limits opportunities; no 360 deal provisions for other revenue streams. |

---

### **Recommendations for the Artist**  
1. **Clarify Net Sales Definition**: Negotiate a transparent formula for calculating net sales.  
2. **Add Reciprocal Obligations**: Require the label to provide marketing, distribution, and studio support.  
3. **Secure IP Ownership**: Ensure the artist retains ownership of masters or negotiate a fair split.  
4. **Include Exit Incentives**: Add clauses for termination with compensation if the label breaches obligations.  
5. **Define Creative Rights**: Explicitly state the artist’s control over creative decisions.  
6. **Expand Revenue Splits**: Negotiate for a share of touring, merch, and sync licensing income.

| # | Risk / Liability | Why it’s a problem for the artist | Potential impact |
|---|------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------|
| 1 | **Broad “Exclusive Recording” clause** – “Artist shall maintain exclusive recording relationship and shall not record with competing labels.” | • Locks the artist into a single label for the entire 3‑year term (and possibly beyond if the label interprets “exclusive” to survive termination). <br>• Prevents the artist from pursuing side projects, collaborations, or independent releases that could generate income or build a fan base. | • Loss of creative freedom and revenue streams.<br>• If the label fails to release the recordings on schedule, the artist is still barred from working elsewhere, effectively “sitting on” unreleased material. |
| 2 | **Unrealistic delivery and promotional obligations** – “Deliver two complete albums (first within 12 months) and perform a minimum of 20 promotional shows per year.” | • The timeline may be impossible if the artist encounters writer’s block, health issues, or production delays. <br>• 20 shows per year (≈ 1‑2 shows per month) can be physically demanding, especially when combined with touring, recording, and personal commitments. | • Failure to meet these milestones can be deemed a breach, giving the label the right to terminate the contract, withhold royalties, or seek damages. <br>• The artist may be forced to rush recordings, compromising quality and long‑term brand value. |
| 3 | **Low royalty rate and “net sales” definition** – “Artist shall receive 12 % of net sales revenue.” | • “Net sales” is a notoriously opaque accounting term; labels often deduct packaging, marketing, distribution, advances, recording costs, and even “overhead” before calculating the net amount. <br>• A 12 % share of a reduced net figure can be far below industry standards for a recording artist (typically 15‑20 % of gross or 50 % of net). | • The artist may receive far less income than expected, even if the albums sell well. <br>• Without an audit clause or clear definition of deductions, the label could under‑report sales, leaving the artist with little recourse. |
| 4 | **Termination on 60‑day notice by either party** – “Either party may terminate with 60 days written notice.” | • Gives the label a quick exit route even if the artist has already invested time and money into the albums. <br>• The artist may be left with unfinished recordings, unrecoverable expenses, and a gap in income while still bound by the exclusivity clause (if the exclusivity survives termination). | • Sudden loss of the label’s support (marketing, distribution, advances) and potential breach penalties if the artist cannot deliver the remaining album(s) on schedule. |
| 5 | **No audit or dispute‑resolution provisions** (not explicitly listed) | • The contract does not mention the artist’s right to audit the label’s books, nor does it specify arbitration or mediation for disputes. | • If the label miscalculates royalties or breaches other terms, the artist may have to pursue costly litigation in California courts, which can be financially and emotionally draining. |

### Summary of the three most critical risks

1. **Exclusivity lock‑in** – limits the artist’s ability to work elsewhere, creating a high dependency on the label’s performance.  
2. **Stringent delivery & performance obligations** – expose the artist to breach claims and possible termination if timelines or show counts cannot be met.  
3. **Unfavorable royalty structure & vague “net sales” definition** – can dramatically reduce the artist’s actual earnings and make it difficult to verify payments.

**Mitigation suggestions (if the artist can renegotiate):**

- Add a **clear definition of “net sales”** and a **right to audit** the label’s accounting records at the artist’s expense.  
- Reduce the exclusivity scope (e.g., allow non‑competing side projects or independent releases after a certain period).  
- Increase the royalty rate or tie it to **gross sales** for at least the first album, and include a **minimum royalty guarantee** or advance recoupment schedule.  
- Insert **performance‑based milestones** (e.g., “reasonable time” for album delivery) and a **force‑majeure clause** for health or personal emergencies.  
- Require a **longer notice period for termination** (e.g., 90 days) and a **termination‑for‑cause** provision that protects the artist if the label fails to meet its promotional or release obligations.

| **Monthly progress updates** | • Requires the artist to allocate time each month to reporting rather than creating music. <br>• Gives the label ongoing oversight that could be used to pressure the artist or to claim breach if updates are deemed “insufficient.” |
| **Exclusive recording relationship** | • Bars the artist from recording for any other label, distributor, or even independent releases. <br>• Limits the ability to collaborate with other artists or to release side projects, remixes, or soundtrack work that could generate income. |
| **12 % of net sales revenue** | • “Net sales” is a notoriously opaque accounting term; deductions (distribution fees, marketing, packaging, “recoupable” expenses, taxes, etc.) can dramatically reduce the actual royalty base. <br>• No minimum royalty guarantee or advance is mentioned, so the artist may receive little to nothing until the label decides the album is “profitable.” |
| **No definition of “net sales” or audit rights** | • Without a clear definition, the label could deduct a wide range of costs before calculating the 12 % share. <br>• Absence of an audit clause means the artist has limited ability to verify the label’s accounting or to challenge questionable deductions. |
| **Minimum 20 promotional shows per year** | • Requires the artist to perform roughly one show every 2‑3 weeks, regardless of touring schedule, personal health, or other commitments. <br>• No provision for exemptions (e.g., illness, pregnancy, travel restrictions) and no compensation for the shows beyond the royalty share. |
| **Either party may terminate with 60‑day written notice** | • Gives the label the same easy exit as the artist, but the artist may be left with unfinished obligations (e.g., an album in progress) and no recoupment of any advance (if one is later added). <br>• If the label terminates early, the artist may lose the right to the recordings already made and may be barred from re‑using them elsewhere. |
| **No reversion clause for masters** | • The agreement does not state that the artist regains ownership of the master recordings after the term ends or after a certain sales threshold. The label could retain the masters indefinitely. |
| **No royalty escalation or performance bonuses** | • The 12 % rate is fixed for the entire three‑year term, even if the artist’s popularity grows. There is no incentive for the label to invest more in promotion or for the artist to negotiate higher rates after a hit release. |
| **No advance against royalties** | • Without an upfront payment, the artist must front all recording, production, and marketing costs, which the label may later recoup from the modest royalty base. |
| **Governing law: California** | • California courts generally favor artists in personal‑service contracts, but the “seven‑year rule” (California Labor Code § 2855) can still be invoked if the label attempts to keep the artist bound beyond a reasonable period. The three‑year term is safe, but the exclusive clause could be challenged if it effectively extends the relationship beyond seven years through successive renewals. |
| **No “Force Majeure” or “Hardship” provision** | • The contract does not address what happens if external events (e.g., natural disasters, pandemics, label restructuring) prevent the artist from meeting deadlines or promotional obligations. |
| **No marketing/ promotion budget specification** | • The label is not required to spend any minimum amount on marketing, yet the artist must deliver 20 shows per year. The artist could be forced to promote a record with little label support, reducing sales and thus royalty income. |
| **No “Right of First Refusal” limitation** | • The exclusive clause may be interpreted as a “right of first refusal” on any future projects, effectively preventing the artist from negotiating better deals elsewhere even after the contract ends. |
| **No “Work‑for‑Hire” clarification** | • If the label claims the recordings are “work‑for‑hire,” the artist may lose songwriting and publishing rights, further limiting future income streams (sync licensing, covers, etc.). |

### Bottom‑Line Takeaways

1. **Financial Exposure** – 12 % of *net* sales without a clear definition or audit rights can leave the artist with a very small payout after the label deducts numerous expenses.  
2. **Creative & Career Flexibility** – The exclusive relationship, strict album deadlines, and mandatory promotional shows heavily restrict the artist’s ability to pursue other opportunities, collaborate, or take needed breaks.  
3. **Control Over Masters & Future Income** – No reversion or ownership clause means the label could retain the masters indefinitely, limiting the artist’s long‑term earning potential.  
4. **Termination Asymmetry** – While both sides can terminate with 60‑day notice, the artist bears the risk of losing unreleased material and any invested money without compensation.  
5. **Missing Protective Provisions** – Lack of audit rights, force‑majeure, marketing budget commitments, and royalty escalations leaves the artist vulnerable to unilateral label decisions.

**Recommendation:** Before signing, the artist should negotiate:

- A **clear definition of “net sales”** and an **audit clause** (right to audit annually at the artist’s expense, with reimbursement if discrepancies are found).  
- A **minimum royalty guarantee or advance** to offset upfront recording costs.  
- **Escalating royalty rates** (e.g., 12 % up to $100,000 in sales, then 15 % thereafter).  
- **Reversion of master rights** after the contract term or upon reaching a sales threshold.  
- **Flexibility clauses** for deadlines (extensions for force‑majeure, health, or creative reasons).  
- **Reduced promotional obligations** (e.g., 10 shows per year, with compensation for additional shows).  
- **A marketing spend commitment** or at least a clause that the label will use “reasonable efforts” to promote the releases.  
- **A termination clause** that provides the artist with compensation or rights to the recordings if the label terminates early.  

Addressing these points will dramatically lower the contractual risk and create a more balanced partnership between the artist and Music Label Records.",3.895829439163208,,"{'term': np.float64(0.21190540748485168), 'delivery_obligation': np.float64(0.22593340519310307), 'reporting_obligation': np.float64(0.004271842086617025), 'exclusivity': np.float64(0.013295936999584862), 'royalty_rate': np.float64(0.24177838627673284), 'performance_obligation': np.float64(0.3202763845115376), 'termination': np.float64(0.22530913255366872)}",0.17753864215801368

### 5️⃣ Summary of the Complete Term Understanding

- **Effective/Commencement Date:** **January 1, 2024**.  
- **Fixed Length:** **Three (3) years** from that date, i.e., the agreement runs **until December 31, 2026** (unless terminated earlier).  
- **Renewal/Extension:** **None** – the contract does not contain an automatic renewal or extension provision. Any continuation beyond Dec 31 2026 would require a new written agreement.  
- **Early Termination:** Either the Label or the Artist may end the contract **anytime** by providing **60 days written notice**. If notice is given, the contract terminates 60 days later, regardless of the original 3‑year schedule.  
- **Resulting Practical Term:**  
  - **Maximum possible term:** Jan 1 2024 → Dec 31 2026 (3 years).  
  - **Actual term** could be shorter if either party exercises the 60‑day termination right.  

Thus, the contract’s **term/duration** is a **3‑year fixed period starting January 1, 2024**, subject to **early termination with 60‑day notice** and **no built‑in renewal**.",1.7537691593170166,,"{'term': np.float64(0.3247955522523699), 'delivery_obligation': np.float64(0.2482041254294842), 'reporting_obligation': np.float64(0.006650350260031094), 'exclusivity': np.float64(0.003986708925942787), 'royalty_rate': np.float64(0.22057026738325283), 'performance_obligation': np.float64(0.32231766633317555), 'termination': np.float64(0.2524833100177975)}",0.1970011400860077

1. **Loss of Creative Control and Income**: The contract requires the artist to obtain management approval for all performance bookings and recording contracts. This could limit the artist's ability to pursue opportunities that they believe are in their best interest, potentially resulting in lost income or missed career opportunities. Additionally, the management company's approval process may lead to delays or rejections, further impacting the artist's career.

2. **High Management Fee**: The contract requires the artist to pay a management fee of 15% of gross earnings. This fee can be substantial, especially if the artist experiences a significant increase in earnings. The high fee may reduce the artist's take-home pay, making it challenging for them to manage their finances and invest in their career.

3. **Lack of Flexibility and Termination Clauses**: The contract has a long initial term of 18 months, which can be automatically renewed for successive one-year periods unless terminated. This means that the artist may be locked into the contract for an extended period, even if they are unhappy with the management company's performance or want to explore other opportunities. The 30-day written notice termination clause may not provide sufficient time for the artist to find alternative representation or adjust to a new management arrangement.

Additional risks that could negatively impact the artist include:

- **Limited Ability to Negotiate**: The contract may not provide the artist with the flexibility to negotiate terms or seek alternative representation.
- **Dependence on the Management Company**: The contract's requirement for the artist to maintain insurance coverage and the management company's first right of refusal for major business opportunities may create a dependence on the management company, limiting the artist's ability to pursue opportunities independently.

**Step 1: Look for words indicating time periods like ""term"", ""duration"", ""years"", ""months""**

- The contract mentions the ""initial term"" which is eighteen (18) months.
- It also mentions ""successive one-year periods"" for renewal.

**Step 2: Identify the starting point (commencement date) if mentioned**

- The contract states that the agreement is ""effective February 1, 2024."" This is the starting point or commencement date.

**Step 3: Look for renewal or extension clauses**

- The contract states that the agreement ""automatically renew[s] for successive one-year periods unless terminated.""
- This means that after the initial 18-month term, the agreement will renew for one year, then another year, and so on, unless terminated.

**Step 4: Note any termination conditions that affect the duration**

- The contract states that the agreement may be terminated by either party with 30 days written notice.
- This means that either party can end the agreement at any time, but they must give 30 days' notice.

- The initial term is 18 months, starting from February 1, 2024.
- After the initial term, the agreement will renew for successive one-year periods.

contract_2,Management Agreement,llama3_8b,llama-3.1-8b-instant,chain_of_thought,risks,"Let's analyze the contract step by step to identify potential risks for the artist:

**Step 1: Identify all monetary commitments, financial penalties, and revenue splits**

- The artist agrees to pay a management fee of 15% of gross earnings to the management company.
- There are no other monetary commitments or financial penalties mentioned in the contract.
- The revenue split is 85% to the artist and 15% to the management company.

**Potential risk:** The artist is committed to paying a significant management fee (15%) of their gross earnings, which could eat into their profits.

**Step 2: Look for termination clauses - can the artist exit, what are the conditions?**

- The contract has a 30-day written notice termination clause, allowing either party to terminate the agreement.
- There are no conditions specified for termination, other than the 30-day notice period.

**Potential risk:** The artist may not have sufficient time to find a new management company or negotiate a new contract before the termination takes effect.

- The artist must obtain management approval for all performance bookings and recording contracts.
- The artist shall not engage other management companies during the term.

**Step 4: Check for creative control limitations or approval requirements**

- The contract does not explicitly mention creative control limitations or approval requirements.

- However, the artist must maintain insurance coverage for performances, which may imply some level of liability protection.

1. **Loss of Creative Control and Autonomy**: The contract requires the artist to obtain management approval for all performance bookings and recording contracts. This could limit the artist's ability to make decisions about their own career and creative direction. If the management company has different visions or priorities, it could lead to conflicts and restrict the artist's freedom to pursue opportunities that align with their goals.

2. **Financial Risks and Commission Fees**: The artist agrees to pay a management fee of 15% of gross earnings, which could be a significant expense. If the artist's earnings are low or unpredictable, the management fee could be a substantial burden. Additionally, the contract does not specify how the management fee will be calculated or what expenses will be deducted from the artist's earnings, which could lead to disputes and financial losses.

3. **Exclusivity and Limitations on Future Opportunities**: The contract stipulates that the artist shall not engage other management companies during the term, and the management company has a first right of refusal for any major business opportunities. This could limit the artist's ability to explore other management options or pursue opportunities that are not presented by the current management company. If the management company is not effective in securing lucrative deals or promoting the artist's career, the artist may be stuck in a contract that is not beneficial to their career advancement.

Additional risks and liabilities for the artist include:

* **Insurance Coverage**: The artist is required to maintain insurance coverage for performances, which could be an added expense. If the artist fails to maintain adequate insurance coverage, they may be liable for any damages or losses incurred during performances.
* **Termination and Notice Period**: The contract can be terminated by either party with 30 days' written notice, which may not provide sufficient time for the artist to find new management or adjust to changes in their career.
* **Governing Law**: The contract is governed by New York law, which may not be familiar to the artist or their legal representatives.

   - ""one-year periods""
   - ""30 days""

2. **Identifying the starting point (commencement date)**: The contract specifies that it is effective as of **February 1, 2024**. This is the commencement date of the agreement.

3. **Looking for renewal or extension clauses**: The contract states that the ""initial term is eighteen (18) months, automatically renewing for successive one-year periods unless terminated."" This means that after the initial 18 months, the contract will automatically renew for 1-year periods unless one of the parties decides to terminate it.

4. **Noting any termination conditions that affect the duration**: The contract can be terminated by either party with **30 days written notice**. This means that regardless of the current term, either the artist or the management company can end the contract by providing a 30-day written notice.

5. **Summarizing the complete term understanding**: 
   - The contract starts on **February 1, 2024**.
   - The initial term lasts for **18 months**.

2. **Look for delivery requirements (music, content, performances):**
   - There are no explicit delivery requirements mentioned in the contract regarding the quantity or quality of music, content, or performances. However, the artist must obtain management approval for all performance bookings and recording contracts, which implies a level of oversight on the artist's activities.

3. **Identify any creative restrictions or approval requirements:**
   - The artist must obtain management approval for all performance bookings and recording contracts, which can be seen as a creative restriction or at least a requirement for approval on the artist's professional decisions.

4. **Note any marketing or promotional obligations:**
   - There are no explicit marketing or promotional obligations mentioned in the contract. The focus is more on the management of the artist's career and the financial aspects thereof.

5. **Check for any exclusivity clauses or non-compete requirements:**
   - The artist ""shall not engage other management companies during the term,"" which is an exclusivity clause.

**Step 1: Identify all monetary commitments, financial penalties, and revenue splits**

* The artist agrees to pay a management fee of 15% of gross earnings. This means that for every dollar the artist earns, they will have to pay $0.15 to the management company.
* There are no explicit financial penalties mentioned in the contract.
* The revenue split is 85% (artist) to 15% (management company), which is a relatively standard split in the industry.

**Step 2: Look for termination clauses - can the artist exit, what are the conditions?**

* The contract has an initial term of 18 months, which automatically renews for successive one-year periods unless terminated.
* Either party can terminate the contract with 30 days' written notice. This is a relatively standard termination clause.
* There are no specific conditions or penalties for termination mentioned in the contract.

**Step 3: Find any one-sided obligations that favor the label/company**

* The artist must obtain management approval for all performance bookings and recording contracts. This gives the management company significant control over the artist's career.
* The management company has a first right of refusal for any major business opportunities. This means that the artist cannot pursue other opportunities without first offering them to the management company.
* The artist shall not engage other management companies during the term, which limits the artist's ability to seek alternative representation.

**Step 4: Check for creative control limitations or approval requirements**

* The contract requires the artist to obtain management approval for all performance bookings and recording contracts. This implies that the management company has some level of creative control over the artist's work.
* However, there is no explicit language limiting the artist's creative control or requiring approval for specific artistic decisions.

**Step 5: Evaluate liability limitations, indemnifications, and ownership of intellectual property**

* The contract does not explicitly address liability limitations or indemnifications.
* There is no language regarding ownership of intellectual property, which could be a significant concern for the artist.

**Step 6: Note any restrictive clauses (exclusivity, non-compete, ""360 deals"")**

* The contract includes an exclusivity clause, which prohibits the artist from engaging other management companies during the term.
* There is no explicit non-compete clause, but the management company's first right of refusal for major business opportunities could be seen as a de facto non-compete provision.
* This is not a ""360 deal,"" which would involve the management company having control over multiple aspects of the artist's career, including music, merchandise, and touring. However, the management company's approval requirements and first right of refusal do give them significant influence over the artist's career.

contract_2,Management Agreement,llama_4_maverick,meta-llama/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct,zero_shot,risks,"Based on the Management Agreement between Artist Sarah Wilson and Talent Management Company, the following are at least 3 key risks that could negatively impact the artist:

1. **Loss of Creative Control and Flexibility**: By requiring management approval for all performance bookings and recording contracts, the artist may be subject to the management company's discretion, potentially limiting her creative freedom and flexibility in pursuing opportunities. If the management company is overly cautious or has differing artistic visions, it could hinder the artist's ability to grow or explore new directions.

2. **Exclusivity and Potential Limitation of Opportunities**: The agreement stipulates that the artist shall not engage other management companies during the term, which could limit the artist's ability to seek alternative representation if she is dissatisfied with the current management company's performance or strategy. This exclusivity clause could also prevent the artist from capitalizing on opportunities that the current management company is not equipped to handle or is not interested in pursuing, despite having the first right of refusal for major business opportunities.

3. **Financial Burden Due to Management Fees and Insurance Requirements**: The artist is required to pay a management fee of 15% of gross earnings, which could significantly reduce her net income. Additionally, the artist is required to maintain insurance coverage for performances, which could be costly. If the artist's earnings are not substantial or if she faces a period of low income, the management fee and insurance costs could become a significant financial burden, potentially impacting her ability to sustain herself financially.

Other potential risks could include:

- **Contractual Obligations and Termination Risks**: The agreement automatically renews unless terminated with 30 days written notice. If the artist wishes to exit the contract, she must adhere to this notice period, which could be challenging if she wants to immediately engage with a different management company or if she is facing a critical career opportunity or crisis.

- **Governing Law and Jurisdiction**: The agreement being governed by New York law could imply additional legal complexities or costs if disputes arise, especially if the artist is not based in New York. This could lead to the artist incurring additional legal fees to navigate New York law.

1. **Initial Term and Renewal**: The contract is effective for 18 months and automatically renews for successive one-year periods unless terminated.
   - **Risk**: The automatic renewal clause may lock the artist into a long-term agreement that might not be favorable if their career trajectory changes or if they become dissatisfied with the management company's services.

2. **Management Fee**: The artist agrees to pay a management fee of 15% of gross earnings.
   - **Risk**: A 15% management fee on gross earnings (as opposed to net earnings) could significantly reduce the artist's take-home pay, potentially impacting their financial stability.

3. **Approval for Performance Bookings and Recording Contracts**: The artist must obtain management approval for all performance bookings and recording contracts.
   - **Risk**: This could potentially slow down the artist's ability to secure opportunities if the management company is not responsive or if there are disagreements. It also gives the management company significant control over the artist's career decisions.

4. **Exclusivity**: The artist shall not engage other management companies during the term.
   - **Risk**: This exclusivity clause restricts the artist's ability to seek alternative management if they are dissatisfied with the current arrangement, potentially limiting their career options.

5. **First Right of Refusal for Major Business Opportunities**: The management company will have the first right of refusal for any major business opportunities.
   - **Risk**: While this could be beneficial in ensuring the management company is involved in significant deals, it also means the artist cannot pursue major opportunities without the management company's approval, potentially stifling their career growth if the management company declines.

6. **Insurance Coverage**: The artist must maintain insurance coverage for performances.
   - **Risk**: While having insurance is generally a good practice, the requirement to maintain it could be a financial burden on the artist, depending on the cost of the insurance.

7. **Termination**: The agreement may be terminated by either party with 30 days written notice.
   - **Mitigating Factor**: This clause provides a relatively straightforward exit strategy for both parties, allowing them to terminate the agreement if needed.

8. **Governing Law**: The agreement is governed by New York law.
   - **Risk/Consideration**: This means that any disputes will be resolved under New York law, which might be unfamiliar to the artist or may not be as favorable as the laws in their home jurisdiction.

**Summary of Risks**:
- Potential long-term commitment due to automatic renewal.
- Significant management fees on gross earnings.
- Management company has considerable control over the artist's career decisions.
- Exclusivity restricts the artist's ability to seek alternative management.
- First right of refusal could impact the artist's ability to pursue major opportunities independently.
- Mandatory insurance coverage could be a financial burden.
- Potential for disputes to be resolved under unfamiliar (New York) law.

1. **Look for words indicating time periods like ""term"", ""duration"", ""years"", ""months""**:
   - The contract mentions ""initial term"" and specifies it as eighteen (18) months.
   - It also mentions ""successive one-year periods"" for renewal.

2. **Identify the starting point (commencement date) if mentioned**:
   - The contract states it is ""effective February 1, 2024"", which is the commencement date.

3. **Look for renewal or extension clauses**:
   - The contract states that the initial term ""automatically renews for successive one-year periods unless terminated"".

4. **Note any termination conditions that affect the duration**:
   - The contract can be terminated by either party with ""30 days written notice"".
   - The automatic renewal clause implies that the contract will continue beyond the initial term unless a termination notice is given.

5. **Summarize the complete term understanding**:
   - The initial term is 18 months starting from February 1, 2024.
   - After the initial 18 months, the contract automatically renews for 1 year at a time.
   - To end the contract after the initial term, a party must give 30 days' written notice before the end of the current term.

Let's calculate the initial term end date:
- Starting date: February 1, 2024
- Initial term: 18 months
- End of initial term: August 1, 2025 (since February 1, 2024 + 18 months = August 1, 2025)

After August 1, 2025, the contract renews automatically for successive one-year periods unless terminated with 30 days' written notice. So, the first renewal term would be until August 1, 2026, and so on.

1. **Identify all ""shall"", ""must"", or ""agrees to"" statements concerning the artist:**
   - ""Artist agrees to pay management fee of 15% of gross earnings."" This indicates the artist's obligation to pay a management fee.
   - ""Artist must obtain management approval for all performance bookings and recording contracts."" This shows the artist must get approval for certain business decisions.
   - ""Artist shall not engage other management companies during the term."" This indicates an exclusivity clause regarding management companies.
   - ""Artist must maintain insurance coverage for performances."" This is another obligation concerning having insurance for performances.

2. **Look for delivery requirements (music, content, performances):**
   - There's no direct mention of delivery requirements for music or content. However, ""all performance bookings"" implies that the artist is expected to perform, and these performances are subject to management approval.

3. **Identify any creative restrictions or approval requirements:**
   - ""Artist must obtain management approval for all performance bookings and recording contracts."" This indicates that the management company has a say in the artist's performance bookings and recording contracts, which can be considered a creative or at least business decision restriction.

4. **Note any marketing or promotional obligations:**
   - There's no explicit mention of marketing or promotional obligations for the artist.

5. **Check for any exclusivity clauses or non-compete requirements:**
   - ""Artist shall not engage other management companies during the term."" This is an exclusivity clause that prevents the artist from working with other management companies.
   - ""Management company will have first right of refusal for any major business opportunities."" While this primarily binds the artist to consider the management company for major opportunities, it implies that the artist is restricted in how they can pursue or agree to major business opportunities without first offering them to the management company.

   - Pay a management fee of 15% of gross earnings.
   - Obtain management approval for all performance bookings and recording contracts.
   - Not engage other management companies during the term of the agreement.

contract_2,Management Agreement,llama_4_maverick,meta-llama/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct,chain_of_thought,risks,"To analyze the artist contract step by step and identify potential risks for the artist, let's break down the given contract according to the specified criteria.

### 1. Identify all monetary commitments, financial penalties, and revenue splits

- **Monetary Commitments:** The artist agrees to pay a management fee of 15% of gross earnings to the management company. This is a clear monetary commitment.
- **Financial Penalties:** There are no explicitly stated financial penalties in the contract provided.
- **Revenue Splits:** The management fee represents a revenue split, where the artist retains 85% of gross earnings, and the management company receives 15%.

**Risk:** The 15% management fee on gross earnings (not net profits) could significantly impact the artist's net income, potentially leaving them with less financial flexibility.

### 2. Look for termination clauses - can the artist exit, what are the conditions?

- The contract states that it ""may be terminated by either party with 30 days written notice."" This means the artist can exit the agreement relatively easily by providing written notice 30 days in advance.

**Risk Assessment:** The termination clause is fairly balanced, allowing both parties to exit with reasonable notice. This doesn't seem to heavily favor the management company.

### 3. Find any one-sided obligations that favor the label/company

- The artist must obtain management approval for all performance bookings and recording contracts. This gives significant control to the management company over the artist's career decisions.
- The artist is prohibited from engaging other management companies during the term, which is a one-sided exclusivity clause favoring the management company.
- The management company has the ""first right of refusal for any major business opportunities,"" further tilting the balance in their favor.

**Risk:** These clauses heavily favor the management company, potentially limiting the artist's ability to make independent decisions or explore other management or business opportunities.

### 4. Check for creative control limitations or approval requirements

- The requirement for management approval for ""all performance bookings and recording contracts"" directly impacts the artist's creative control and business decisions.

**Risk:** This could slow down decision-making processes and potentially lead to conflicts if the artist and management company have differing opinions on opportunities.

### 5. Evaluate liability limitations, indemnifications, and ownership of intellectual property

- The contract mentions that the artist ""must maintain insurance coverage for performances."" While this is a prudent measure, it doesn't directly indicate a risk unless the cost or terms of this insurance are onerous or not clearly defined.
- There's no explicit mention of liability limitations, indemnifications, or the ownership of intellectual property in the provided contract.

**Risk Assessment:** The absence of information on liability, indemnification, and intellectual property ownership is a concern. Typically, contracts should clarify these points to avoid future disputes.

### 6. Note any restrictive clauses (exclusivity, non-compete, ""360 deals"")

- The contract includes an exclusivity clause (""Artist shall not engage other management companies during the term""), which is restrictive.
- While not a traditional ""360 deal"" (which typically involves the label or management company receiving a percentage of all the artist's revenue streams, not just those directly managed by them), the management company's first right of refusal on ""any major business opportunities"" could be seen as somewhat akin to a 360 deal in its restrictiveness.

**Risk:** These clauses could limit the artist's freedom to work with other professionals or explore different business opportunities outside of the management company's purview.

### Summary of Risks:

1. **Financial:** High management fees on gross earnings.
2. **Control and Flexibility:** Significant management approval requirements and exclusivity clauses.
3. **Opportunity:** Potential limitation on exploring other business or management opportunities due to the first right of refusal clause.
4. **Unclear Provisions:** Lack of clarity on liability, indemnification, and intellectual property ownership.

The artist should carefully consider these risks, potentially negotiating for more favorable terms, such as a lower management fee, clearer guidelines on approval processes, and more flexibility in working with other professionals or on other business ventures.",1.8064253330230713,,"{'term': np.float64(0.004813597487900286), 'management_fee': np.float64(0.3377485692015858), 'approval_requirement': np.float64(0.36035682677688397), 'exclusivity': np.float64(0.03978073144644761), 'first_right_refusal': np.float64(0.0765009222119714), 'insurance_requirement': np.float64(0.31881811873079824), 'termination': np.float64(0.2253556742040631)}",0.19476777715137863

Okay, let's see. The user wants me to analyze the artist contract and extract the term or duration of the agreement. They specified to return only the specific term mentioned.

First, I'll read through the contract text carefully. The contract is a Management Agreement between Sarah Wilson and a Talent Management Company, effective February 1, 2024. The key part here is the initial term. The sentence says, ""The initial term is eighteen (18) months, automatically renewing for successive one-year periods unless terminated."" 

So the initial term is 18 months. Then after that, it renews for one-year periods each time unless someone terminates it. The user is asking for the term/duration, so I need to make sure I capture both the initial period and the renewal terms. However, the user might just want the initial term, but the example in the query shows that when there's an initial term and automatic renewal, the answer includes both. For example, if the contract said ""2 years with automatic renewal,"" the term would be ""2 years with automatic renewal for successive one-year periods."" 

Looking back at the contract, the exact wording is ""initial term is eighteen (18) months, automatically renewing for successive one-year periods unless terminated."" So the term is 18 months initially, then renews each year unless terminated. The user wants the specific term mentioned, so I should include both parts. 

I need to check if there's any other mention of duration elsewhere in the contract. The rest of the contract talks about management fees, approval for bookings, termination with 30 days notice, etc. No other duration terms are mentioned. The termination clause allows either party to terminate with 30 days notice, but that's about ending the agreement, not the term itself. 

So the term is the initial 18 months plus automatic renewal for one-year periods. The answer should be exactly as stated in the contract. The user wants only the specific term, so I shouldn't add any interpretation beyond what's written. Therefore, the correct extraction is ""eighteen (18) months, automatically renewing for successive one-year periods unless terminated.""

Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to identify all the key obligations and responsibilities of the artist from the given management agreement. First, I need to read through the contract carefully to make sure I don't miss any details.

Starting with the initial term and renewal. The contract says it's 18 months with automatic renewal for one-year periods. But the user is asking about the artist's obligations, so maybe the term itself isn't an obligation, but the fact that it renews unless terminated could be relevant. Wait, the obligations are what the artist has to do, so maybe the term length isn't an obligation but the automatic renewal might affect the artist's responsibilities. Hmm, maybe not. Let me focus on the actual duties.

Next, the management fee of 15% of gross earnings. That's definitely an obligation the artist has to pay. Then, the artist must get management approval for performance bookings and recording contracts. So that's another key point. They can't book shows or sign recording deals without the company's okay.

The artist can't engage other management companies during the term. That's a non-compete clause. Also, the management company has the first right of refusal for major business opportunities. So the artist has to offer those opportunities to the management first before going elsewhere. 

Maintaining insurance coverage for performances is another obligation. The artist is responsible for that. Termination with 30 days written notice is a mutual right, but the artist has to follow that process if they want to end the contract. The governing law is New York, but that's more about legal jurisdiction, not an obligation per se.

Wait, let me check again. The user wants bullet points of the artist's obligations. So the key points are: paying the 15% fee, getting approval for bookings and contracts, not using other managers, allowing first right of refusal, maintaining insurance, and following the 30-day termination notice. The initial term and renewal are part of the contract structure but not obligations. The governing law is also part of the contract terms but not an obligation the artist has to perform.

I need to make sure I didn't miss any. Let me go through each sentence again. The contract mentions the initial term, management fee, approval for bookings and contracts, no other management companies, first right of refusal, insurance, termination notice, and governing law. The obligations are the actions the artist must take. So the bullet points should include paying the fee, seeking approval, not engaging other managers, allowing first right of refusal, maintaining insurance, and providing termination notice. The rest are structural or legal terms, not obligations. Alright, that should cover it.

contract_2,Management Agreement,qwen_32b,qwen/qwen3-32b,zero_shot,risks,"<think>
Okay, let's see. The user wants me to identify three key risks for the artist in this management contract. The contract is between Sarah Wilson and a talent management company. Let me start by going through the contract terms one by one.

First, the initial term is 18 months with automatic renewal for one-year periods. That means if Sarah doesn't do anything, the contract keeps renewing. That could be a problem if she wants out after 18 months but the company keeps it going. She might have to wait a year to terminate, which is a risk because she's tied up longer than she expected.

Next, the management fee is 15% of gross earnings. That's a standard rate, but if Sarah's earnings are high, this could eat into her profits. But maybe the bigger issue is that she has to pay this fee even if the management isn't performing well. If the company isn't helping her get good deals, she's still paying 15%, which is a financial risk.

Then, she needs management approval for all performance bookings and recording contracts. That gives the management company a lot of control over her career. If they hold up approvals or make decisions that aren't in her best interest, she's stuck. For example, if they approve a low-paying gig instead of a better one, she can't say no. That's a loss of autonomy and potential income.

Also, she can't engage other management companies during the term. So even if she's unhappy with the current management, she can't get another manager to help her. This exclusivity could prevent her from getting better opportunities or support if the current management isn't effective.

The first right of refusal for major business opportunities is another point. If a big opportunity comes up, the management company gets to decide whether to take it or not. If they decline, Sarah can't go to someone else. This could limit her chances to capitalize on important deals.

The insurance requirement is a bit of a risk too. If she doesn't maintain the required insurance, she might face penalties or be in breach of contract. Plus, insurance can be expensive, adding to her costs.

Termination with 30 days notice seems manageable, but if the management company is uncooperative, she might have to wait the full 30 days, which could be problematic if she needs to exit quickly. Also, governed by New York law might not be favorable if she's in another state, but the user didn't mention that as a risk, so maybe that's not the main issue here.

Putting this all together, the three key risks would likely be:

1. Automatic renewal leading to extended commitment without the artist's active consent.
2. Loss of control over career decisions due to management approval requirements.
3. Financial risks from the management fee and potential for poor decision-making by the management company affecting income.

Wait, the user asked for three key risks. Let me check if there's another one. The exclusivity clause preventing other management companies is another risk, but maybe that's part of the loss of control. Also, the first right of refusal could be a separate risk. Hmm. Maybe the three main ones are the automatic renewal, the management's control over bookings and contracts, and the financial exposure from the fee and insurance. Yeah, that makes sense. Let me structure them clearly.
</think>

Here are **three key risks** for the artist (Sarah Wilson) in this management agreement:

---

### **1. Automatic Renewal Without Active Consent**  
The contract automatically renews for successive one-year terms unless Sarah actively terminates it. This creates a **risk of extended commitment** without her consent, potentially locking her into the management relationship indefinitely if she fails to monitor the contract’s expiration dates. This could prevent her from pursuing opportunities or exiting the partnership if the management company underperforms or acts against her interests.

---

### **2. Loss of Autonomy Over Career Decisions**  
The requirement to obtain management approval for all performance bookings, recording contracts, and major business opportunities (via the ""first right of refusal"") **centralizes decision-making power with the management company**. This risks:  
- **Poor decision-making**: If the management company prioritizes its own interests (e.g., low-paying gigs or unfavorable deals), Sarah may lose control over her artistic direction and income.  
- **Delayed or blocked opportunities**: Management could withhold approval for lucrative or artistically meaningful projects, stifling her career growth.  

---

### **3. Financial Exposure and Dependency**  
- **15% management fee**: Sarah pays 15% of her gross earnings regardless of the management company’s performance. If the company fails to secure high-value opportunities, she bears the financial loss while still paying the fee.  
- **Insurance costs**: She must maintain performance insurance, which could be expensive and add to her expenses without direct control over the policy terms.  
- **Limited exit options**: The exclusivity clause (no other management companies) and 30-day termination notice restrict her ability to seek alternative support if the management company underperforms.  

---

### **Additional Considerations**  
- **First Right of Refusal**: If the management company declines a major opportunity (e.g., a high-profile collaboration), Sarah cannot pursue it independently, potentially missing career-defining chances.  
- **New York Law Jurisdiction**: If Sarah is based elsewhere, New York law may favor the management company in disputes, creating an imbalance in legal protections.  

These risks highlight the importance of negotiating clear termination clauses, performance benchmarks, and safeguards against poor decision-making by the management company.",4.366124868392944,,"{'term': np.float64(0.3162040414512633), 'management_fee': np.float64(0.3308273567027219), 'approval_requirement': np.float64(0.05372746929175396), 'exclusivity': np.float64(0.039443232662190325), 'first_right_refusal': np.float64(0.07164798972035014), 'insurance_requirement': np.float64(0.01611015278177248), 'termination': np.float64(0.2222052718091561)}",0.15002364491702977

Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to analyze the given artist contract and determine the term. Let me start by reading through the contract details carefully.

First, the contract is a Management Agreement between Sarah Wilson and a Talent Management Company, effective February 1, 2024. The initial term is stated as eighteen (18) months. Then it mentions that it automatically renews for successive one-year periods unless terminated. So the initial term is 18 months, and after that, it renews each year unless someone decides to terminate it. 

Looking at the examples provided, Example 1 had a fixed term of 2 years without renewal, so the term was straightforward. Example 2 had an initial 12-month term with automatic renewal, so the term was noted as 12 months with automatic renewal. 

In the current contract, the initial term is 18 months, and then it renews for one-year periods. The key here is that the initial period is longer than the renewal periods. So the term should be stated as 18 months with automatic renewal for one-year periods. The user probably wants the term to be concise, similar to the examples. 

I need to make sure I don't miss any other details. The contract also mentions termination with 30 days notice, but that's about how to end the agreement, not the term itself. The other clauses about fees, approvals, etc., are part of the agreement's terms but not the duration. 

So the main points are the initial 18 months and the automatic renewal for one-year periods. Therefore, the term should be written as ""18 months with automatic renewal for one-year periods."" That matches the structure of the examples provided. Let me double-check the contract text again to confirm. Yes, the initial term is 18 months, and then it renews for successive one-year periods. No mention of a maximum term, so it's just the initial plus automatic renewals. 

I think that's all. The answer should be straightforward based on the examples given.
</think>

**Term:** 18 months with automatic renewal for one-year periods  

This reflects the initial 18-month term and the provision for successive one-year renewals unless terminated, as outlined in the contract.",1.6348187923431396,,"{'term': np.float64(0.36859706950129667), 'management_fee': np.float64(0.005835304489771332), 'approval_requirement': np.float64(0.016502174832947716), 'exclusivity': np.float64(0.005451304078348484), 'first_right_refusal': np.float64(0.015048066659452256), 'insurance_requirement': np.float64(0.009348850192998422), 'termination': np.float64(0.22163719199676105)}",0.09177428025022513

Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to analyze the given artist contract and list the obligations. Let me start by reading through the contract carefully.

First, the contract is a Management Agreement between Sarah Wilson and a Talent Management Company, effective from February 1, 2024. The initial term is 18 months, and it automatically renews for one-year periods unless terminated. So, the duration is important here. 

Next, the artist agrees to pay a management fee of 15% of gross earnings. That's a key financial obligation. Then, the artist must obtain management approval for all performance bookings and recording contracts. So, any bookings or contracts need the management's okay. 

The artist can't engage other management companies during the term. That means exclusivity. The management company has the first right of refusal for major business opportunities. So if there's a big opportunity, the management gets to decide first. 

The artist must maintain insurance coverage for performances. That's a safety requirement. Termination can be done by either party with 30 days written notice. Also, the agreement is governed by New York law.

Now, I need to list these as obligations. Let me make sure I don't miss any. The initial term and renewal are part of the agreement but not obligations. The obligations are the things the artist has to do. So:

1. Pay 15% management fee of gross earnings.
2. Obtain management approval for performance bookings and recording contracts.
3. Not engage other management companies during the term.
4. Allow management company first right of refusal for major business opportunities.
5. Maintain insurance coverage for performances.
6. Provide 30 days written notice to terminate the agreement.

Wait, the termination clause is about how to terminate, but the obligation here is to give notice if they want to terminate. So that's an obligation. Also, the insurance is a must. 

I should check if there's anything else. The management's first right of refusal is an obligation on the artist to let them consider first. The exclusivity clause is another obligation. 

I think that's all. Let me structure them clearly as bullet points under Obligations.
</think>

**Obligations:**  
- Pay a 15% management fee of gross earnings to the management company.  
- Obtain management company approval for all performance bookings and recording contracts.  
- Refrain from engaging other management companies during the term of the agreement.  
- Grant the management company the first right of refusal for any major business opportunities.  
- Maintain insurance coverage for all performances.  
- Provide 30 days’ written notice to terminate the agreement (if either party wishes to end the contract).

contract_2,Management Agreement,qwen_32b,qwen/qwen3-32b,few_shot,risks,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this contract analysis. The user wants me to identify the risks in the management agreement between Sarah Wilson and the Talent Management Company. Let me start by reading through the contract details carefully.

First, the initial term is 18 months with automatic renewal for one-year periods. That means if Sarah doesn't actively terminate, the contract keeps going. That's a risk because she might forget to terminate, leading to long-term obligations. I should note that as a potential issue.

Next, the management fee is 15% of gross earnings. While 15% is lower than the 20% in Example 1, it's still a significant cut of her income. Depending on her earnings, this could affect her net income. Maybe mention that even though it's lower, it's still a financial risk.

Then, she needs management approval for all performance bookings and recording contracts. That gives the management company a lot of control over her career decisions. If they're unresponsive or have conflicting interests, she might miss opportunities. That's a risk related to autonomy.

The contract also states she can't engage other management companies during the term. This exclusivity could limit her options if she's unhappy with the management. If they're not performing well, she can't seek help elsewhere until the contract ends. That's another autonomy risk.

The management company has the first right of refusal for major business opportunities. So if a big opportunity comes up, Sarah can't just take it; the management has to respond first. If they decline, she can take it, but if they don't respond in time, maybe she loses the chance. That's a risk because it could delay or block her from seizing opportunities.

She must maintain insurance coverage for performances. That's a financial obligation. If she doesn't have insurance, she might face penalties or have to pay out of pocket. Also, the cost of insurance could be an added expense.

The termination clause allows either party to end the contract with 30 days notice. While that's a positive, it's a two-way street. The management could leave, but Sarah might be stuck if they don't renew. However, the main risk here is the automatic renewal unless she actively terminates. So she needs to remember to send the notice, which is easy to forget.

The contract is governed by New York law. Depending on Sarah's location, this might be a risk if she's not familiar with New York's legal framework. Legal disputes would be under New York jurisdiction, which could be inconvenient or costly if she's in another state.

Putting this all together, the main risks are around long-term commitment with automatic renewal, financial implications from the management fee and insurance, loss of autonomy in career decisions, and potential limitations on business opportunities. I should list these clearly, maybe in bullet points as in the examples. Also, check if there's anything else I missed, like the 30-day notice period being a risk if the management terminates first. But the user's examples didn't mention that, so maybe it's not a risk unless the management can terminate without cause. The contract says either party can terminate with 30 days notice, so Sarah can leave too. So maybe that's not a risk but a benefit. Hmm. The risks are more about the management's control and financial obligations. Alright, I think that's covered.
</think>

**Risks in the Management Agreement:**  

1. **Automatic Renewal Clause**  
   - The 18-month term automatically renews for one-year periods unless terminated. This creates a risk of long-term commitment without active renewal decisions, potentially locking the artist into the agreement indefinitely if oversight occurs.  

2. **Management Control Over Career Decisions**  
   - The artist must obtain management approval for all performance bookings and recording contracts. This grants the management company significant control over the artist’s career, potentially limiting creative or business opportunities if the management acts against the artist’s interests.  

3. **Exclusivity Restrictions**  
   - The artist cannot engage other management companies during the term. This restricts the artist’s ability to seek alternative support or negotiate better terms if dissatisfied with the current management.  

4. **First Right of Refusal for Major Opportunities**  
   - The management company has the first right of refusal for major business opportunities. This could delay or block the artist from pursuing opportunities if the management declines or delays their response.  

5. **Insurance Obligations**  
   - The artist is required to maintain performance insurance. This adds a financial burden and potential liability if the artist fails to comply, risking penalties or legal issues.  

6. **Financial Dependency on Management**  
   - The 15% management fee, while lower than some examples, still reduces the artist’s gross earnings. Combined with the management’s control over bookings and contracts, this creates financial dependency and limits the artist’s autonomy in maximizing income.  

7. **Jurisdictional Risks**  
   - The agreement is governed by New York law. If the artist is based elsewhere, this could complicate legal disputes, requiring travel or legal costs to navigate unfamiliar jurisdictional rules.  

8. **Termination Notice Complexity**  
   - While termination is possible with 30 days’ notice, the automatic renewal clause requires proactive action to avoid unintended extensions. Failure to send timely termination notices could result in prolonged obligations.  

**Summary:** The contract prioritizes management control and long-term stability for the management company, potentially at the expense of the artist’s flexibility, financial independence, and ability to pursue opportunities. Key risks include loss of autonomy, financial obligations, and restrictive exclusivity terms.",4.134801387786865,,"{'term': np.float64(0.3228401112379923), 'management_fee': np.float64(0.3222165159252472), 'approval_requirement': np.float64(0.34667715159045265), 'exclusivity': np.float64(0.3353764742320738), 'first_right_refusal': np.float64(0.05929321224552861), 'insurance_requirement': np.float64(0.3190268595225983), 'termination': np.float64(0.3291006413915713)}",0.2906472808779234
contract_2,Management Agreement,qwen_32b,qwen/qwen3-32b,chain_of_thought,term_extraction,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this contract analysis step by step. First, I need to figure out the term or duration of the Management Agreement between Sarah Wilson and the Talent Management Company. The user provided a structured approach, so I'll follow each step carefully.

Starting with step 1: Look for words indicating time periods. The contract mentions ""initial term is eighteen (18) months"" and ""automatically renewing for successive one-year periods unless terminated."" So the initial term is 18 months, and then it renews every year unless someone terminates it. That's a key point.

Step 2 is identifying the starting point. The contract says it's effective February 1, 2024. So the term begins on that date. That's straightforward.

Moving to step 3: Renewal or extension clauses. The contract states that after the initial 18 months, it automatically renews for one-year periods. But it's important to note that this is automatic unless terminated. So unless either party gives notice to terminate, it keeps renewing each year. The user should check if there's a specific notice period for termination related to renewal. The termination clause here is 30 days written notice, but that's for termination at any time, not specifically for non-renewal. Wait, the contract says ""unless terminated,"" so maybe the termination notice applies here. If either party wants to end the agreement before the next renewal, they need to give 30 days notice. But if they don't terminate, it just renews automatically. So the renewal is automatic unless terminated, which requires 30 days notice.

Step 4: Termination conditions. The contract allows either party to terminate with 30 days written notice. So even during the initial 18-month term, either side can end the agreement by giving 30 days notice. That means the term isn't fixed for the entire 18 months if one party decides to terminate early. But if they don't terminate, it goes through the 18 months and then renews each year. Also, the termination clause doesn't mention any exceptions or conditions beyond the 30 days notice. So the duration is flexible depending on whether they choose to terminate.

Step 5: Summarize the complete term. The agreement starts on February 1, 2024, with an initial term of 18 months. After that, it renews automatically for one-year periods unless either party gives 30 days written notice to terminate. So the total duration could be 18 months plus any number of one-year renewals, but it's not fixed. The actual term depends on when either party decides to terminate it. The termination clause allows for ending the agreement at any time with 30 days notice, which affects the overall duration because the agreement isn't bound to a specific end date beyond the initial term unless renewed.

Wait, but the initial term is 18 months. So if they don't terminate during that time, it renews for one year. Then, if they don't terminate again, it renews another year, and so on. The termination can happen at any time, so the total duration isn't fixed. The user needs to note that the term is initially 18 months, then renews annually unless terminated. The termination clause allows for ending the agreement at any time with 30 days notice, which means the actual duration could be as short as 30 days after the start date if terminated early, or it could go on indefinitely with renewals unless terminated.

I should also check if there's any mention of a maximum term or a condition that would prevent automatic renewal. The contract doesn't mention any such conditions. The only way the term ends is through termination. So the term is flexible, starting with 18 months and then annual renewals unless terminated. The key points are the initial term, the automatic renewal, and the termination clause with 30 days notice.
</think>

**Step-by-Step Analysis of the Management Agreement Term:**

1. **Identify Time Periods:**  
   - The contract specifies an **initial term of 18 months**.  
   - After the initial term, it **automatically renews for successive one-year periods** unless terminated.  

2. **Starting Point (Commencement Date):**  
   - The agreement is **effective February 1, 2024**.  

3. **Renewal/Extension Clauses:**  
   - The agreement renews **automatically** for one-year periods after the initial 18 months.  
   - **No explicit notice period** is required to *opt out* of renewal; termination is the only mechanism to end the agreement.  

4. **Termination Conditions:**  
   - Either party can **terminate the agreement at any time** (during the initial term or after renewals) with **30 days written notice**.  
   - Termination does not require cause, and the 30-day notice applies regardless of the term phase.  

5. **Summary of Term/Duration:**  
   - **Initial Term:** 18 months (February 1, 2024, to July 31, 2025).  
   - **Post-Initial Term:** Automatically renews for **one-year periods** unless terminated.  
   - **Termination Flexibility:** Either party can end the agreement at any time with 30 days notice, even during the initial term or after renewals.  
   - **Total Duration:** Potentially indefinite (18 months + any number of one-year renewals) unless terminated.  

**Final Understanding:**  
The agreement begins on February 1, 2024, with a fixed 18-month term. Afterward, it renews annually unless either party provides 30 days written notice to terminate. The total duration is not fixed and depends on whether termination occurs. The 30-day termination notice applies at any stage, allowing flexibility for early exit.",6.228147268295288,,"{'term': np.float64(0.2577086016032313), 'management_fee': np.float64(0.007417779525321587), 'approval_requirement': np.float64(0.012209726319576775), 'exclusivity': np.float64(0.001959270208069303), 'first_right_refusal': np.float64(0.014336313801981283), 'insurance_requirement': np.float64(0.008901894055602537), 'termination': np.float64(0.27648451951467506)}",0.08271687214692255
contract_2,Management Agreement,qwen_32b,qwen/qwen3-32b,chain_of_thought,obligations,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to analyze the artist contract and identify all the artist's obligations. The contract is a Management Agreement between Sarah Wilson and a Talent Management Company, effective from February 1, 2024. The initial term is 18 months with automatic renewal for one-year periods unless terminated. 

First, I need to look for any ""shall"", ""must"", or ""agrees to"" statements related to the artist. The contract mentions that the artist agrees to pay a 15% management fee. That's a clear obligation. Then there's a statement that the artist must obtain management approval for all performance bookings and recording contracts. So that's another obligation. Also, the artist shall not engage other management companies during the term. That's an exclusivity clause.

Next, delivery requirements. The contract doesn't mention specific deliverables like music or content, but the approval requirements for bookings and contracts might relate to performances. So maybe the artist has to submit these for approval, which is a form of delivery requirement.

Creative restrictions or approval requirements: The artist must get approval for performance bookings and recording contracts. That's a creative restriction because the management has control over those decisions. Also, the management has the first right of refusal for major business opportunities, which could affect the artist's creative or business decisions.

Marketing or promotional obligations: The contract doesn't explicitly mention marketing or promotional duties. The artist isn't required to do anything in that area beyond what's covered in the management's role.

Exclusivity clauses or non-compete requirements: The artist can't engage other management companies during the term. That's an exclusivity clause. Also, the management's first right of refusal might act as a non-compete in a way, but it's more about priority than a direct non-compete.

Summarizing all obligations: The artist must pay the management fee, get approval for bookings and contracts, not use other management companies, maintain insurance, and allow the management to have first refusal on major opportunities. The termination notice is 30 days, but that's a mutual right, not an obligation of the artist. The governing law is New York, which is a legal clause, not an obligation.

Wait, the user also mentioned checking for exclusivity clauses. The exclusivity here is the artist not engaging other management companies. The first right of refusal is more about priority than exclusivity. So that's covered under exclusivity. Also, the management's right to approve bookings and contracts is a creative restriction. The insurance requirement is another obligation. So all these points need to be listed under their respective categories.

### Key Takeaways  
The artist’s obligations center on **financial compliance**, **creative/decision-making restrictions** (via approvals and exclusivity), and **legal compliance** (insurance and termination notice). The contract prioritizes management’s control over the artist’s career decisions and business opportunities.",8.205521821975708,,"{'term': np.float64(0.306248857932333), 'management_fee': np.float64(0.32341089842941934), 'approval_requirement': np.float64(0.40378426423528263), 'exclusivity': np.float64(0.3583491888821004), 'first_right_refusal': np.float64(0.08911194920081575), 'insurance_requirement': np.float64(0.037630024556850064), 'termination': np.float64(0.2181244238142233)}",0.2480942295787178
contract_2,Management Agreement,qwen_32b,qwen/qwen3-32b,chain_of_thought,risks,"<think>
Okay, let's start analyzing this management agreement step by step as per the user's request. First, I need to break down each of the six points they mentioned and check the contract for relevant clauses.

Starting with monetary commitments and financial penalties. The contract states a 15% management fee on gross earnings. That's a standard rate, but I should note that it's a significant portion of the artist's income. There's no mention of any penalties for non-payment or other financial penalties, so maybe that's a risk if the artist can't meet obligations. Also, the artist has to maintain insurance, which is an additional cost. Not sure if there's a cap on the management fee or if it's fixed. The revenue split here is 15% to the management, so the artist keeps 85%, but that's only if they can manage their own finances and insurance.

Next, termination clauses. The agreement automatically renews every year unless terminated. The termination notice is 30 days for either party. That seems fair, but the automatic renewal could be a problem if the artist wants to exit after the initial 18 months. They need to remember to send a termination notice each year, which might be easy to forget. Also, the management company has a first right of refusal for major opportunities, which could tie the artist down even if they want to move on. The exclusivity clause means the artist can't work with other managers, which might limit their options if they're unhappy.

Looking for one-sided obligations. The artist must get management approval for bookings and recording contracts. That gives the management a lot of control over the artist's career. The exclusivity clause is another one-sided point because the artist can't seek other management help. The first right of refusal might also be one-sided if the management can block opportunities by not responding in time. The insurance requirement is on the artist, which is standard, but if the management doesn't cover that, it's an extra cost for the artist.

Creative control limitations. The contract doesn't mention anything about creative input, so maybe the artist has full control there. But the approval for bookings and contracts could indirectly affect creative direction if the management chooses opportunities that don't align with the artist's vision. However, the user's point is about explicit limitations, so maybe that's not a direct issue here.

Liability and IP ownership. The contract doesn't specify who owns the intellectual property. That's a big risk because if the artist creates music during the agreement, the management might claim ownership. Also, there's no indemnification clause mentioned, so if the artist faces legal issues, they might be on their own. The insurance requirement is on the artist, which could mean they're liable for any performance-related incidents, but the management isn't covering that.

Restrictive clauses like exclusivity and non-compete. The exclusivity clause is clear—no other management companies. The non-compete isn't explicitly stated, but the exclusivity might act similarly by preventing the artist from working with others. The first right of refusal is a restrictive clause because it gives the management priority over opportunities, which could limit the artist's ability to take other offers. The 360 deal isn't mentioned here, but the management's involvement in all aspects (bookings, contracts, insurance) might resemble a 360 deal, which can be risky if the management takes a cut from multiple revenue streams.

Putting it all together, the main risks are the high management fee, automatic renewal without clear exit terms, exclusivity limiting the artist's options, potential IP ownership issues, and the lack of indemnification. The artist should be cautious about the management's control over their career decisions and the financial obligations like insurance. They might need to negotiate better terms, such as a lower fee, clearer termination conditions, and IP ownership clarification.

### **Step-by-Step Analysis of Risks in the Management Agreement**

---

#### **1. Monetary Commitments, Financial Penalties, and Revenue Splits**  
- **Management Fee**:  
  - The artist pays **15% of gross earnings** to the management company. This is a standard rate but could be risky if the artist’s income is unstable or if the management company fails to deliver value.  
  - **Risk**: The fee is not capped, meaning the artist could pay 15% even during low-earning periods.  

- **Insurance Requirement**:  
  - The artist must maintain **performance insurance**, adding an unquantified financial burden.  
  - **Risk**: If the artist cannot afford insurance, they may be unable to perform, violating the contract.  

- **No Penalties for Management**:  
  - The contract does not specify penalties for the management company if they fail to meet obligations (e.g., securing bookings or opportunities).  
  - **Risk**: The artist is financially bound to the management company regardless of performance.  

---

#### **2. Termination Clauses**  
- **Automatic Renewal**:  
  - The agreement renews for **one-year terms** unless terminated. The artist must actively terminate it each year, which could lead to accidental long-term commitments.  
  - **Risk**: The artist may be locked into the agreement indefinitely if they forget to send a termination notice.  

- **30-Day Notice**:  
  - Either party can terminate with **30 days’ written notice**, which is fair. However, the management company’s **first right of refusal** for major opportunities could delay the artist’s exit.  
  - **Risk**: If the artist terminates the agreement, the management company could block opportunities during the 30-day notice period.  

---

#### **3. One-Sided Obligations Favoring the Management Company**  
- **Exclusive Management**:  
  - The artist **cannot engage other management companies** during the term. This limits their ability to seek alternative support if the management company underperforms.  
  - **Risk**: The artist is dependent on a single entity for career decisions.  

- **First Right of Refusal**:  
  - The management company has **priority** for major business opportunities. This could prevent the artist from accepting offers from third parties.  
  - **Risk**: The management company may delay or reject opportunities to retain control over the artist’s career.  

- **Approval Requirements**:  
  - The artist must obtain management approval for **performance bookings and recording contracts**. This gives the management company unilateral control over the artist’s professional decisions.  
  - **Risk**: The artist’s creative or business goals may be stifled if the management company rejects opportunities.  

---

#### **4. Creative Control Limitations**  
- **No Explicit Creative Restrictions**:  
  - The contract does not mention restrictions on creative output (e.g., songwriting, album themes).  
  - **Risk**: While creative freedom is preserved, the management company’s approval over bookings and contracts could indirectly influence the artist’s creative direction (e.g., favoring certain venues or labels).  

---

#### **5. Liability, Indemnification, and IP Ownership**  
- **Liability for Insurance**:  
  - The artist is responsible for **performance insurance**, but the contract does not clarify who covers legal liabilities (e.g., if a performance causes injury or property damage).  
  - **Risk**: The artist may bear full legal and financial responsibility for incidents during performances.  

- **No Indemnification Clause**:  
  - There is no mention of indemnification (compensation for losses caused by the management company’s actions).  
  - **Risk**: If the management company’s decisions lead to legal or financial harm, the artist may not be reimbursed.  

- **IP Ownership Ambiguity**:  
  - The contract does not specify ownership of intellectual property (e.g., recordings, songs).  
  - **Risk**: The management company could claim ownership of the artist’s work, especially if they contribute to its creation or promotion.  

---

#### **6. Restrictive Clauses**  
- **Exclusivity**:  
  - The artist cannot work with other management companies, which limits their ability to diversify support or negotiate better terms.  
  - **Risk**: The artist is tied to a single entity, even if the management company fails to deliver results.  

- **First Right of Refusal**:  
  - The management company’s priority for major opportunities acts as a **non-compete clause**, preventing the artist from freely accepting third-party offers.  
  - **Risk**: The artist may lose lucrative opportunities if the management company delays or rejects them.  

- **No 360 Deal Mentioned**:  
  - While not a 360 deal (which typically includes revenue from touring, merch, etc.), the management company’s control over bookings and contracts resembles a 360 structure.  
  - **Risk**: The artist’s entire revenue stream is subject to the management company’s influence.

Below are three (and a few additional) key risk areas that could negatively affect the artist under the terms you provided.  The analysis is for informational purposes only and does **not** constitute legal advice.  If you need a definitive assessment, consult a qualified entertainment‑law attorney licensed in New York.

| # | Risk / Liability | Why it matters / How it could hurt the artist | Typical mitigation strategies |
|---|------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **1** | **Broad “first‑right‑of‑refusal” / “first right of refusal for any major business opportunities”** | • The contract does not define what qualifies as a “major business opportunity.”  Management could interpret even modest offers (e.g., a small endorsement, a sync license, a regional tour) as “major,” forcing the artist to present the opportunity first and potentially lose it if the manager declines. <br>• This can limit the artist’s ability to act quickly on time‑sensitive deals and may result in missed revenue or career‑building chances. | • Seek a clear definition (e.g., minimum dollar threshold, type of deal, geographic scope). <br>• Add a carve‑out for “opportunities that do not require management services” or that the artist may pursue independently. <br>• Include a reasonable response window (e.g., 5‑7 business days) for the manager to accept/decline. |
| **2** | **Mandatory management approval for *all* performance bookings and recording contracts** | • The artist must obtain written approval before any gig or recording deal.  If the manager is slow to respond, unresponsive, or declines opportunities that the artist deems valuable, the artist could lose income, exposure, or momentum. <br>• The clause may also give the manager leverage to shape the artist’s artistic direction or touring schedule without the artist’s consent. | • Require the manager to respond within a set timeframe (e.g., 48‑72 hours). <br>• Add a “good‑faith” standard: the manager must not unreasonably withhold approval. <br>• Allow the artist to proceed after a specified period of silence (e.g., “if no response within 5 business days, approval is deemed granted”). |
| **3** | **Automatic renewal for successive one‑year periods** | • After the initial 18‑month term, the agreement rolls over each year unless either party gives 30‑day notice.  This can trap the artist in a long‑term relationship even if the partnership becomes unsatisfactory, especially because the 30‑day notice period is short relative to the length of the renewal term. | • Negotiate a longer notice period for renewal termination (e.g., 90 days). <br>• Add a performance‑based review clause (e.g., renewal only if certain revenue or KPI thresholds are met). <br>• Consider a maximum number of automatic renewals (e.g., no more than two successive one‑year extensions). |
| **4** *(additional)* | **15 % management fee on *gross* earnings** | • “Gross earnings” typically include all income before any deductions (e.g., taxes, production costs, travel expenses).  The artist pays the fee on money that may never reach their pocket, effectively increasing the cost of doing business. | • Redefine the fee base to “net earnings” after reasonable expenses, or at least carve out specific expense categories. <br>• Request an audit right to verify the calculation of gross earnings. |
| **5** *(additional)* | **Exclusive representation & prohibition on other managers** | • The artist cannot engage any other manager or agent during the term, even if the current manager is under‑performing.  This limits the artist’s ability to seek alternative representation or supplemental services (e.g., a booking agent) without breaching the contract. | • Add a “material breach” clause that allows the artist to terminate early if the manager fails to meet agreed‑upon performance metrics (e.g., minimum number of bookings, revenue targets). |
| **6** *(additional)* | **Insurance requirement without specification** | • The artist must maintain “insurance coverage for performances,” but the contract does not specify the type, limits, or who bears the cost.  The artist could be left paying for expensive policies that may be unnecessary or insufficient. | • Define the required coverage (e.g., general liability $1 M per occurrence, equipment insurance) and clarify whether the manager reimburses any portion. <br>• Include a provision that the manager will assist in obtaining appropriate coverage. |

### How These Risks Could Materially Impact the Artist

1. **Lost Income & Opportunities** – Delayed or denied approvals and an over‑broad right of first refusal can prevent the artist from capitalizing on timely gigs, sync placements, or brand deals, directly reducing earnings and career momentum.

2. **Higher Operating Costs** – Paying a percentage on gross earnings and bearing unspecified insurance costs can erode net profit margins, especially for emerging artists whose cash flow is already tight.

3. **Reduced Flexibility & Autonomy** – Automatic renewals and exclusive representation lock the artist into a relationship that may become unfavorable, limiting the ability to pivot to a more effective manager or to explore independent projects.

4. **Potential Legal Exposure** – Ambiguous language (e.g., “major business opportunities,” “gross earnings”) can lead to disputes, costly audits, or litigation, especially under New York law where courts strictly interpret contract terms.

### Practical Next Steps for the Artist

| Action | Reason |
|--------|--------|
| **Request clarifying language** for “major business opportunities,” “gross earnings,” and insurance requirements. | Reduces ambiguity and limits managerial discretion. |
| **Insert response‑time and good‑faith standards** for booking/recording approvals. | Prevents bottlenecks and ensures the artist can act promptly. |
| **Negotiate a longer notice period** (e.g., 60‑90 days) for termination of automatic renewals. | Gives the artist adequate time to plan a transition if the relationship sours. |
| **Add performance benchmarks** (e.g., minimum number of bookings, revenue targets) that trigger the right to terminate for cause. | Provides an exit route if the manager under‑delivers. |
| **Seek audit rights** and a clear fee calculation method. | Allows the artist to verify that the 15 % fee is applied correctly. |
| **Consider a “sunset” clause** limiting the number of successive renewals (e.g., max three years total). | Prevents indefinite binding without renegotiation. |

---

**Bottom line:** While the agreement gives the manager significant control over the artist’s career, several provisions are vague or overly restrictive. Clarifying definitions, setting reasonable timelines, and adding performance‑based safeguards can dramatically reduce the artist’s exposure to financial loss, missed opportunities, and loss of autonomy. A qualified entertainment‑law attorney can draft the necessary amendments and ensure the final contract aligns with the artist’s goals and New York legal standards.",3.701159715652466,,"{'term': np.float64(0.2188922015135622), 'management_fee': np.float64(0.24282913346479357), 'approval_requirement': np.float64(0.04139519427290347), 'exclusivity': np.float64(0.007111576765711989), 'first_right_refusal': np.float64(0.039885374022071894), 'insurance_requirement': np.float64(0.025912051936670025), 'termination': np.float64(0.22770868585942805)}",0.11481917397644874

*Note:* The contract does not expressly list any affirmative duties for the management company beyond the right of first refusal; any implied obligations (e.g., duty to act in good faith, to provide reasonable career guidance, to negotiate on the Artist’s behalf) would be interpreted under standard agency law in New York.",1.5765867233276367,,"{'term': np.float64(0.214733996366693), 'management_fee': np.float64(0.24712768577272332), 'approval_requirement': np.float64(0.04925133209499485), 'exclusivity': np.float64(0.03317968401640436), 'first_right_refusal': np.float64(0.07215763176186939), 'insurance_requirement': np.float64(0.030121867883180664), 'termination': np.float64(0.23121719702387208)}",0.12539848498853395

| # | Clause / Issue | Why It’s a Risk for the Artist | Potential Impact |
|---|----------------|--------------------------------|------------------|
| 1 | **15 % Management Fee on “gross earnings”** | *Gross* earnings are not defined – they may include gross ticket sales, merchandise, sponsorships, advances, and even reimbursements. Without a clear definition the fee could be taken from money the artist would otherwise keep. | The artist could end up paying the manager on revenue that is not truly profit, dramatically reducing net income. |
| 2 | **Exclusive relationship – “shall not engage other management companies”** | Bars the artist from hiring additional representation (e.g., a booking agent, public‑relations firm, or a specialist manager) even if the current manager is not delivering. | Limits the artist’s ability to seek better terms or specialized expertise; may trap the artist in an under‑performing relationship. |
| 3 | **All performance bookings & recording contracts require management approval** | Gives the manager “veto power” over every deal. The contract does not set any standards for what constitutes “reasonable” or “unreasonable” approval, nor does it provide a timeline for the manager’s response. | The artist could miss time‑sensitive opportunities, be forced to accept sub‑optimal deals, or be left in limbo while waiting for approval. |
| 4 | **First right of refusal on any “major business opportunities”** | “Major” is vague; the manager could claim a modest sync‑licensing deal or a small endorsement is “major,” thereby blocking the artist from pursuing it independently. | The artist may lose revenue or exposure because the manager either declines the opportunity or delays the decision. |
| 5 | **Automatic renewal for successive one‑year periods** | The contract rolls over unless the artist actively terminates it. The 30‑day termination notice (see #7) is short relative to a 12‑month renewal period, making it easy to miss the deadline. | The artist could be locked into another year of an unfavorable agreement simply by overlooking the renewal date. |
| 6 | **30‑day written notice termination by either party** | A 30‑day window is very short for an artist who may need time to transition to new representation, settle pending projects, or negotiate a new deal. | Sudden termination could leave the artist without management support mid‑tour, mid‑recording, or without a plan for ongoing royalty collection. |
| 7 | **Requirement that the artist maintain insurance coverage for performances** | The contract does not specify the type or minimum limits of insurance, nor who pays the premiums. If the artist is required to purchase and fund coverage, this adds a non‑trivial cost. | Unexpected out‑of‑pocket expenses; potential liability if the required coverage is insufficient or lapses. |
| 8 | **Governing law – New York** | New York law is generally favorable to management companies (e.g., broader interpretation of “gross earnings,” stronger enforcement of exclusivity clauses). The artist may have to travel or retain New York counsel for any dispute. | Higher legal costs and a less favorable jurisdiction if a dispute arises. |
| 9 | **No audit or accounting rights for the artist** | The agreement does not grant the artist the right to audit the manager’s books or to receive regular, itemized statements. | The artist may be unable to verify that the 15 % fee is correctly calculated or that all earnings are being reported. |
| 10 | **No cap or limitation on “major business opportunities”** | Because the first‑right clause is unlimited, the manager could theoretically claim a right of refusal on every deal, even low‑value ones, creating bottlenecks. | Inefficiency and possible loss of revenue if the manager declines or delays many opportunities. |
| 11 | **No performance benchmarks for the manager** | The contract does not require the manager to meet any minimum performance standards (e.g., number of bookings, revenue targets, marketing deliverables). | The artist may be stuck with a passive or ineffective manager with no recourse other than termination (which, as noted, is difficult). |
| 12 | **No indemnification or limitation of liability clause** | If the manager’s negligence causes a loss (e.g., missed booking, breach of contract with a label), the artist may have limited protection. | Potential exposure to damages or lost earnings caused by the manager’s actions. |
| 13 | **No confidentiality or non‑disparagement provisions** | While not a direct financial risk, the lack of confidentiality clauses could allow the manager to disclose sensitive career information or make public statements that could harm the artist’s reputation. | Reputation damage, loss of future opportunities. |
| 14 | **No clear definition of “gross earnings” vs. “net earnings”** | Without a definition, the manager could deduct expenses (travel, marketing, studio time) before calculating the fee, effectively increasing the percentage taken. | The artist’s take‑home pay could be far lower than anticipated. |
| 15 | **No provision for dispute resolution (mediation/arbitration)** | The contract jumps straight to litigation under New York law. | Dispute resolution could become costly and time‑consuming. |

---

### Summary of the Most Critical Concerns

1. **Fee Structure Ambiguity** – 15 % of an undefined “gross earnings” can erode the artist’s net income dramatically.  
2. **Exclusivity & Approval Controls** – The artist loses autonomy over bookings, contracts, and any “major” opportunity, creating bottlenecks and limiting career flexibility.  
3. **Automatic Renewal + Short Termination Notice** – Easy to be locked into another year of an unfavorable deal; 30‑day notice is insufficient for a smooth transition.  
4. **Lack of Accounting/Audit Rights** – No way for the artist to verify that earnings are reported correctly or that the fee is calculated properly.  
5. **First Right of Refusal Without Limits** – Vague language can be abused to block even modest opportunities.  

---

### Recommendations for the Artist (or Their Legal Counsel)

| Action | Reason |
|--------|--------|
| **Define “gross earnings”** (e.g., gross receipts before taxes, but after direct expenses) and require a **monthly, itemized accounting statement**. | Prevents fee over‑calculation and provides transparency. |
| **Add a cap or floor on the management fee** (e.g., 15 % of net earnings after reasonable expenses) or negotiate a lower percentage if the manager’s services are limited. | Aligns fee with actual profit and reduces financial burden. |
| **Insert performance benchmarks** for the manager (minimum number of bookings, revenue targets, marketing deliverables). | Gives the artist a measurable standard to evaluate the manager’s effectiveness. |
| **Limit the “first right of refusal”** to truly major opportunities (e.g., deals > $X, label contracts, major endorsements) and require the manager to respond within a set timeframe (e.g., 5 business days). | Prevents unnecessary bottlenecks and ensures timely decisions. |
| **Add a clear termination clause** that allows the artist to exit with **90‑day notice** (or at the end of each 12‑month renewal) and includes a **transition assistance** provision (hand‑over of contacts, accounting, etc.). | Gives the artist sufficient time to secure new representation and avoid abrupt disruption. |
| **Specify insurance requirements** (type, minimum coverage limits, who pays premiums) and possibly allow the manager to reimburse the artist for required premiums. | Avoids unexpected costs and ensures adequate coverage. |
| **Include audit rights** (artist may audit the manager’s books annually at the manager’s expense if a discrepancy >5 %). | Provides a check on financial reporting. |
| **Add a dispute‑resolution clause** (mandatory mediation followed by binding arbitration in New York) to reduce litigation costs. | Faster, cheaper resolution of disagreements. |
| **Consider a jurisdiction clause** that allows the artist to bring actions in the artist’s home state (or a mutually convenient venue) if the artist is not based in New York. | Reduces travel and legal expenses for the artist. |
| **Insert indemnification provisions** protecting the artist from the manager’s negligence or breach. | Limits the artist’s exposure to damages caused by the manager. |
| **Add confidentiality and non‑disparagement clauses** to protect the artist’s reputation and private information. | Safeguards the artist’s brand. |

### Bottom Line

While the agreement is fairly standard for a management relationship, the combination of a relatively high fee on an undefined revenue base, broad exclusivity and approval requirements, an unrestricted first‑right of refusal, and an automatic renewal mechanism creates significant risk for Sarah Wilson. Negotiating clearer definitions, performance standards, audit rights, and more balanced termination provisions will dramatically improve the artist’s ability to protect her earnings and career flexibility.",4.621434211730957,,"{'term': np.float64(0.0084842990462779), 'management_fee': np.float64(0.252062977505603), 'approval_requirement': np.float64(0.03287848865479113), 'exclusivity': np.float64(0.009153101431464925), 'first_right_refusal': np.float64(0.04072279176343672), 'insurance_requirement': np.float64(0.01824104484704503), 'termination': np.float64(0.22066698946766827)}",0.08317281324518386

| 1 | **Time‑period language** (e.g., “term”, “duration”, “months”, “years”) | • “The initial term is **eighteen (18) months**.”<br>• “Automatically renewing for **successive one‑year periods** unless terminated.” | The contract explicitly defines a fixed initial length (18 months) and a renewal length (1 year). |
| 2 | **Commencement / starting point** | “**Effective February 1, 2024**.” | The clock starts on 1 Feb 2024. |
| 3 | **Renewal / extension clauses** | “Automatically renewing for successive **one‑year periods** unless terminated.” | At the end of the 18‑month initial term, the agreement will **continue** for another 12‑month period, and thereafter will keep rolling over each year, **provided neither party ends it**. |
| 4 | **Termination conditions that affect duration** | • “This agreement may be terminated by **either party with 30 days written notice**.” | Either side can stop the contract at any time (including during the initial 18‑month term or any renewal year) by giving 30 days’ notice. If notice is given, the automatic renewal is cut off and the agreement ends after the notice period. |
| 5 | **Other relevant provisions** | • “Artist shall not engage other management companies **during the term**.”<br>• “Management company will have first right of refusal for any major business opportunities.” | These clauses reinforce that the “term” is the period during which the exclusivity and first‑refusal rights apply. They do not change the length, but they clarify what obligations exist while the term is in force. |

### Complete Summary of the Contract’s Term

1. **Start Date:** The agreement becomes effective on **February 1, 2024**.  
2. **Initial Duration:** It runs for **18 months**, ending on **July 31, 2025** (the day before the 19th month begins).  
3. **Automatic Renewal:** Unless either party gives written notice of termination, the agreement **automatically renews** for successive **one‑year (12‑month) periods** after the initial term.  
4. **Termination Right:** **Either party** may end the agreement at **any time** by delivering **30 days written notice**. Giving notice during a renewal period stops the next automatic renewal; giving notice during the initial term ends the contract after the 30‑day notice period.  
5. **Practical Effect:**  
   * If no notice is given, the contract will continue:  
     - **Feb 1 2024 – July 31 2025** (initial 18 months)  
     - **Aug 1 2025 – July 31 2026** (first renewal year)  
     - **Aug 1 2026 – July 31 2027** (second renewal year) … and so on, each year automatically rolling over.  
   * If either party serves notice on, say, **June 1 2025**, the agreement would terminate on **June 30 2025** (30 days later), cutting short the initial term.  

**Bottom line:** The contract’s term is **18 months starting Feb 1 2024**, with **automatic 1‑year renewals** thereafter, but **either party can end it at any time with 30 days’ written notice**, which overrides the automatic renewal mechanism.",2.083461284637451,,"{'term': np.float64(0.26375197272427), 'management_fee': np.float64(0.007252537759731845), 'approval_requirement': np.float64(0.012376693799975818), 'exclusivity': np.float64(0.009358744438077738), 'first_right_refusal': np.float64(0.027740217894866512), 'insurance_requirement': np.float64(0.008117754906612444), 'termination': np.float64(0.2679762236880878)}",0.08522487788737458

| # | Exact wording that creates an obligation for the Artist (contains “shall”, “must”, or “agrees to”) | What the clause requires |
|---|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| 1 | **“Artist agrees to pay management fee of 15 % of gross earnings.”** | Pay the Management Company a fee equal to 15 % of all gross earnings the Artist generates (record sales, touring, merchandising, etc.). |
| 2 | **“Artist must obtain management approval for all performance bookings and recording contracts.”** | Before signing any live‑performance agreement or any recording contract, the Artist must first get written (or otherwise documented) approval from the Management Company. |
| 3 | **“Artist shall not engage other management companies during the term.”** | The Artist is prohibited from hiring, contracting with, or otherwise working with any other manager, talent‑representation, or booking agency while this Agreement is in effect. |
| 4 | **“Artist must maintain insurance coverage for performances.”** | The Artist must keep an active insurance policy (general liability, cancellation, workers‑comp, etc., as appropriate) that covers each live performance she gives. |
| 5 | **(Implied) “Management company will have first right of refusal for any major business opportunities.”** | While not phrased with “shall/must”, it creates an obligation for the Artist to first present any major opportunity (e.g., major label deals, film/TV syncs, endorsement contracts) to the Management Company and wait for its decision before pursuing anyone else. |

---

### 1. Delivery requirements (music, content, performances)

- **Performance bookings** – The Artist must secure management approval before any concert, tour, festival, or live‑event booking can be finalized.  
- **Recording contracts** – The Artist must obtain management approval before entering any recording agreement (label, distribution, publishing, etc.).  
- No explicit requirement to deliver a set number of songs, albums, or recordings; the only “delivery” is the act of obtaining prior approval for the above items.

---

### 2. Creative restrictions / approval requirements

- **Approval gate** – All performance bookings and recording contracts are subject to Management’s sign‑off. The Artist cannot unilaterally decide on these creative/commercial activities.  
- **Exclusivity with management** – The Artist may not engage any other manager, which limits her ability to seek alternative creative guidance or representation.  
- **First right of refusal** – The Artist must present any “major business opportunity” to Management first, effectively restricting her freedom to negotiate directly with third parties on those opportunities.

---

### 3. Marketing or promotional obligations

- The contract **does not contain any explicit marketing, publicity, or promotional duties** (e.g., attending press events, social‑media posts, interviews, etc.).  
- Any such obligations would have to be inferred from the management‑approval clauses (e.g., if a promotional appearance is part of a performance booking, it would need Management’s approval).

---

### 4. Exclusivity / non‑compete requirements

- **“Artist shall not engage other management companies during the term.”** – This is a clear exclusivity clause; the Artist is bound to a single manager for the entire term.  
- **First right of refusal** – While not a classic non‑compete, it further limits the Artist’s ability to work with other parties on “major” opportunities without giving Management the chance to step in.  
- No broader non‑compete (e.g., prohibition from performing in the same genre for other entities) is stated.

---

### 5. Summary of all Artist obligations

1. **Financial** – Pay Management a 15 % fee on all gross earnings.  
2. **Approval** – Obtain Management’s written approval before:  
   - Booking any live performance (concerts, tours, festivals, etc.).  
   - Signing any recording contract (label, distribution, publishing, etc.).  
3. **Exclusivity** – Remain exclusively represented by this Management Company; do not hire or contract any other manager during the term.  
4. **First right of refusal** – Present any major business opportunity to Management first and wait for its decision before pursuing other parties.  
5. **Insurance** – Keep active, adequate insurance coverage for every performance she gives.  
6. **Termination notice** – Either party may end the agreement with 30 days written notice (the Artist must be prepared to cease the above obligations upon termination).  

These points constitute the total set of contractual duties the Artist, Sarah Wilson, must fulfill under the Management Agreement.",2.951322555541992,,"{'term': np.float64(0.007369770568918195), 'management_fee': np.float64(0.2448270135292441), 'approval_requirement': np.float64(0.38682601141379247), 'exclusivity': np.float64(0.050450184281099), 'first_right_refusal': np.float64(0.07428545295471613), 'insurance_requirement': np.float64(0.3402245261525031), 'termination': np.float64(0.22468571794089992)}",0.1898098109773104

The following is a general, non‑legal‑advice overview of the contract language you provided. It is intended to help you spot potential issues that you may want to discuss with a qualified attorney who can give you personalized advice based on the full agreement and your specific situation.

---

## 1. Monetary Commitments, Financial Penalties & Revenue Splits  

| Clause (as written) | What it means | Potential risk for the artist |
|----------------------|---------------|------------------------------|
| **“Artist agrees to pay management fee of 15 % of gross earnings.”** | Every dollar the artist earns (record sales, streaming, touring, merch, sponsorships, etc.) is reduced by 15 % before the artist receives the remainder. | • **High fee** – 15 % of *gross* (not net) earnings can be costly, especially if the artist incurs significant expenses (e.g., travel, production, legal fees) that are not deducted first. <br>• **No cap** – The fee applies for the entire 18‑month term and any renewals, regardless of the artist’s income level. |
| **“Artist must maintain insurance coverage for performances.”** | The artist is responsible for purchasing and paying for performance‑related insurance (general liability, cancellation, etc.). | • **Additional expense** that the artist must budget for; the contract does not specify a maximum or who chooses the insurer, leaving the artist exposed to potentially high premiums. |
| **No explicit financial penalties** (e.g., late‑payment fees, breach fines) are listed in the excerpt. | – | • The absence of stated penalties does not mean they can’t be added elsewhere in the full agreement. Be sure to review the entire document for any “liquidated damages” or “default” provisions. |

---

## 2. Termination Clauses – Can the Artist Exit?  

| Clause | What it says | How it works for the artist |
|--------|--------------|----------------------------|
| **“This agreement may be terminated by either party with 30 days written notice.”** | Either the artist or the management company can end the relationship by giving a 30‑day notice in writing. | • **Flexibility:** The artist can walk away, but must give notice and continue to comply with all obligations (e.g., paying the 15 % fee on earnings generated during the notice period). <br>• **Potential downside:** If the artist terminates early, any pending “major business opportunities” that the manager has a right of first refusal on may still be bound to the manager until the notice period ends. |
| **Automatic renewal:** “initial term is 18 months, automatically renewing for successive one‑year periods unless terminated.” | After the first 18 months, the contract rolls over each year unless one party gives notice. | • **Risk of “ever‑green” relationship:** If the artist forgets to give notice before the renewal date, the contract continues for another year, locking the artist into the 15 % fee and other obligations for longer than intended. |
| **No early‑termination fee** is mentioned in the excerpt. | – | • While there’s no explicit penalty, the artist should verify whether the full agreement imposes any “break‑up” fees, repayment of advances, or reimbursement of expenses upon early termination. |

---

## 3. One‑Sided Obligations Favoring the Management Company  

| Clause | Why it leans toward the manager |
|--------|---------------------------------|
| **“Artist must obtain management approval for all performance bookings and recording contracts.”** | The manager controls when and where the artist can work, potentially limiting the artist’s ability to accept lucrative or strategic opportunities without manager consent. |
| **“Artist shall not engage other management companies during the term.”** | Exclusivity prevents the artist from seeking additional representation that might negotiate better terms or provide complementary services. |
| **“Management company will have first right of refusal for any major business opportunities.”** | The manager gets the chance to take any big deal before the artist can consider other parties, which could be used to steer the artist toward deals that benefit the manager (e.g., higher commissions) rather than the artist. |
| **Renewal provision** (automatic yearly renewal) | Keeps the manager in place indefinitely unless the artist actively terminates, which can be easy to overlook. |
| **No explicit performance benchmarks for the manager** (e.g., “manager must secure X bookings per year”) | The manager is not contractually obligated to deliver a minimum level of service, yet the artist bears the cost of the 15 % fee regardless of results. |

---

## 4. Creative Control Limitations / Approval Requirements  

| Clause | Effect on creative freedom |
|--------|----------------------------|
| **“Artist must obtain management approval for all performance bookings and recording contracts.”** | The manager can veto or delay gigs, tours, or recording deals that the artist deems artistically important. This can limit the artist’s ability to experiment, collaborate, or respond quickly to market trends. |
| **No mention of “artistic direction,” “song selection,” or “production decisions.”** | While not expressly stated, the requirement for manager approval on *recording contracts* could indirectly affect which labels, producers, or creative teams the artist works with. |
| **No carve‑out for “self‑produced” or “independent releases.”** | If the artist wants to release music independently (e.g., via a personal Bandcamp page), the contract may still require manager sign‑off, potentially stifling DIY initiatives. |

---

## 5. Liability Limitations, Indemnifications & IP Ownership  

The excerpt you provided does **not** contain explicit language on:

* **Liability caps** (e.g., “the manager shall not be liable for indirect damages”)
* **Indemnification** (who must cover legal costs if a third party sues)
* **Intellectual property ownership** (who owns the master recordings, publishing, trademarks, etc.)

**Why this matters:**

| Potential clause | Risk if missing or one‑sided |
|------------------|------------------------------|
| **IP ownership clause** (e.g., “all masters and compositions created during the term are owned by the manager”) | If the contract later assigns ownership of the artist’s recordings or songs to the manager, the artist could lose control and future revenue streams. |
| **Indemnification** (e.g., “artist shall indemnify manager against any claims arising from artist’s performances”) | Without clear limits, the artist could be on the hook for large legal costs caused by the manager’s negligence. |
| **Limitation of liability** (e.g., “manager’s liability limited to the amount of fees paid”) | If absent, the manager could be held fully liable for breaches, but the artist may also be exposed to unlimited liability for their own breaches. |
| **Force‑majeure / insurance** | The contract requires the artist to maintain insurance, but does not state what happens if a covered event forces a cancellation. Clarify who bears the loss. |

**Action:** Review the full agreement for any of these sections. If they are missing, consider negotiating language that:

* Clearly states the artist retains ownership of all masters, compositions, and related IP (or at least a reversion clause after a set period).
* Limits the artist’s indemnification obligations to matters within the artist’s control.
* Caps the manager’s liability to a reasonable amount (e.g., total fees earned).

---

## 6. Restrictive Clauses (Exclusivity, Non‑Compete, “360” Deals)  

| Clause | Restriction type | Implications |
|--------|------------------|--------------|
| **Exclusivity:** “Artist shall not engage other management companies during the term.” | **Exclusive representation** – the artist cannot hire another manager or agent for any services covered by this agreement. | • Limits the artist’s ability to bring in specialists (tour manager, publicist) who might charge separate fees. <br>• If the manager underperforms, the artist is stuck with them for the entire term. |
| **First right of refusal** for “any major business opportunities.” | **Right of first refusal (ROFR)** – the artist must first offer the opportunity to the manager before pursuing it elsewhere. | • Can delay negotiations with other parties. <br>• May give the manager leverage to negotiate a higher commission or to block deals the manager deems unfavorable to them. |
| **No explicit “non‑compete”** clause is shown, but the ROFR and exclusivity together function similarly by preventing the artist from working with other representatives. | – | • If the artist wants to sign with a label or a publishing company that requires its own representation, the ROFR could create a conflict. |
| **No “360‑deal” language** (i.e., manager taking a cut of merch, endorsements, etc.) is present",4.687956094741821,,"{'term': np.float64(0.22267990059946283), 'management_fee': np.float64(0.23551711172338044), 'approval_requirement': np.float64(0.33548027680677345), 'exclusivity': np.float64(0.012681736993940426), 'first_right_refusal': np.float64(0.03929314740620356), 'insurance_requirement': np.float64(0.32577973886514955), 'termination': np.float64(0.22747128377575687)}",0.19984331373866673

contract_3,Distribution Deal,llama3_8b,llama-3.1-8b-instant,zero_shot,risks,"Based on the provided contract, the following are three key risks that could negatively impact the artist:

1. **Loss of Exclusive Rights**: The artist grants the distributor exclusive digital distribution rights worldwide. This means that if the artist wants to distribute their music through another platform or distributor, they may be in breach of contract, potentially leading to termination of the agreement. This could limit the artist's ability to explore alternative distribution channels or negotiate better deals with other distributors.

2. **Termination for Failure to Meet Sales Threshold**: The distributor may terminate the agreement if the artist fails to meet the minimum sales threshold of 100,000 streams in the first year. This creates a high-pressure situation for the artist, who may feel compelled to produce music that is commercially viable rather than artistically fulfilling. If the artist is unable to meet this threshold, they may lose access to the distributor's services and potentially suffer financial losses.

3. **Financial Burden of Production Costs and Copyright Clearances**: The artist is responsible for all production costs and copyright clearances, which can be a significant financial burden. If the artist is not successful in generating revenue through streaming, they may struggle to cover these costs, potentially leading to financial difficulties or even bankruptcy. This could also limit the artist's ability to invest in future projects or explore new creative opportunities.

Additional risks that could negatively impact the artist include:

* **Lack of Control over Music Distribution**: The artist has limited control over how their music is distributed and marketed by the distributor.
* **Unclear Revenue Reporting**: The contract does not specify how revenue will be reported or paid to the artist, which could lead to disputes or delays in payment.
* **Governing Law**: The agreement is governed by Texas law, which may not be favorable to the artist if they are not familiar with the laws and regulations of that state.
* **Limited Protection for Artist's Rights**: The contract does not provide clear protections for the artist's rights, such as ownership of their music or control over their creative work.",0.9140396118164062,,"{'term': np.float64(0.0), 'revenue_split': np.float64(0.03209316672054271), 'delivery_obligation': np.float64(0.011080959935026677), 'rights_granted': np.float64(0.3229483946760401), 'costs_responsibility': np.float64(0.061570171328498076), 'termination_threshold': np.float64(0.24663911831242383)}",0.11238863516208857
contract_3,Distribution Deal,llama3_8b,llama-3.1-8b-instant,few_shot,term_extraction,"Based on the provided contract, the term can be broken down as follows:

1. Initial Term: 24 months (2 years)
2. Automatic Renewal: There is no mention of automatic renewal in the contract, so it is likely that the agreement will terminate after the initial 24 months unless it is renewed or extended by the parties.

Additionally, there are some conditions that may affect the term of the agreement:

1. Termination Clause: The distributor may terminate the agreement if the artist fails to meet the minimum sales threshold of 100,000 streams in the first year. This means that if the artist meets this threshold, the agreement will continue for the full 24 months. If the artist fails to meet this threshold, the distributor may terminate the agreement.

3. **Production Costs**: The artist is responsible for all production costs associated with their music.
4. **Minimum Sales Threshold**: The artist must meet a minimum sales threshold of 100,000 streams in the first year to avoid termination of the agreement by the distributor.

contract_3,Distribution Deal,llama3_8b,llama-3.1-8b-instant,few_shot,risks,"Based on the provided contract, the following risks can be identified:

1. **Low Revenue Share**: The artist retains only 70% of streaming revenue, while the distributor takes 30%. This means that for every dollar earned from streaming, the artist only gets 70 cents, which may not be sufficient to cover production costs and other expenses.

2. **Short Delivery Deadline**: The artist must deliver music in the specified format within 30 days before the release date. This creates pressure on the artist to meet the deadline, which may lead to rushed or subpar work.

3. **Exclusive Digital Distribution Rights**: The artist grants the distributor exclusive digital distribution rights worldwide. This means that the artist cannot distribute their music through other digital platforms, limiting their career freedom and potential revenue streams.

4. **Production Costs and Copyright Clearances**: The artist is responsible for all production costs and copyright clearances. This may be a significant financial burden on the artist, especially if they are not well-established or have limited resources.

5. **Termination Clause**: The distributor may terminate the agreement if the artist fails to meet the minimum sales threshold of 100,000 streams in the first year. This creates a risk for the artist, as they may be penalized for not meeting an arbitrary sales target.

6. **Governing Law**: The agreement is governed by Texas law, which may not be favorable to the artist. This could lead to disputes and potential litigation if issues arise.

7. **Limited Control**: The artist has limited control over the distribution of their music, as the distributor has exclusive rights to digital distribution. This may limit the artist's ability to promote their music or connect with their audience.

Overall, this contract appears to favor the distributor, with the artist bearing significant risks and responsibilities. It is essential for the artist to carefully review and negotiate the terms of the contract to ensure they are fair and beneficial to their career.",0.813631534576416,,"{'term': np.float64(0.0), 'revenue_split': np.float64(0.2612468716009159), 'delivery_obligation': np.float64(0.23226636672387813), 'rights_granted': np.float64(0.3315648635085835), 'costs_responsibility': np.float64(0.06726334510046471), 'termination_threshold': np.float64(0.24039966683526862)}",0.18879018562818514
contract_3,Distribution Deal,llama3_8b,llama-3.1-8b-instant,chain_of_thought,term_extraction,"Let's analyze the contract step by step to determine the term/duration.

**Step 1: Look for words indicating time periods like ""term"", ""duration"", ""years"", ""months""**

The contract mentions: ""This agreement shall remain in effect for a period of twenty-four (24) months.""

This indicates that the term of the contract is 24 months.

**Step 2: Identify the starting point (commencement date) if mentioned**

The contract mentions: ""Distribution Agreement between Independent Artist Mike Brown and Digital Distributor Corp dated March 1, 2024.""

This indicates that the starting point of the contract is March 1, 2024.

**Step 3: Look for renewal or extension clauses**

There are no renewal or extension clauses mentioned in the contract.

**Step 4: Note any termination conditions that affect the duration**

The contract mentions: ""Distributor may terminate agreement if artist fails to meet minimum sales threshold of 100,000 streams in first year.""

This condition affects the duration of the contract, but it does not specify a new term or extension. If the artist fails to meet the minimum sales threshold, the distributor may terminate the agreement, which would end the contract.

**Step 5: Finally, summarize the complete term understanding**

Based on the analysis, the term of the contract is 24 months, starting from March 1, 2024. There are no renewal or extension clauses, and the distributor may terminate the agreement if the artist fails to meet the minimum sales threshold of 100,000 streams in the first year. If the agreement is terminated, the contract will end.

So, the complete term understanding is:

* Starting date: March 1, 2024
* Term: 24 months

contract_3,Distribution Deal,llama3_8b,llama-3.1-8b-instant,chain_of_thought,obligations,"Let's analyze the contract step by step to identify all artist obligations.

**Step 1: Identify ""shall"", ""must"", or ""agrees to"" statements concerning the artist**

1. ""This agreement shall remain in effect for a period of twenty-four (24) months."" - This is a statement about the duration of the agreement, not an obligation of the artist.
2. ""Artist must deliver music in specified format within 30 days before release date."" - This is an obligation of the artist to deliver music in a specified format on time.
3. ""Artist grants distributor exclusive digital distribution rights worldwide."" - This is an obligation of the artist to grant exclusive rights to the distributor.

**Step 2: Look for delivery requirements (music, content, performances)**

1. ""Artist must deliver music in specified format within 30 days before release date."" - This is a delivery requirement for music.
2. Artist is responsible for ""all production costs"" - This implies that the artist is responsible for delivering music that meets certain production standards.
3. Artist is responsible for ""copyright clearances"" - This implies that the artist is responsible for ensuring that their music does not infringe on any existing copyrights.

**Step 3: Identify any creative restrictions or approval requirements**

1. None mentioned in the contract.

**Step 4: Note any marketing or promotional obligations**

1. None mentioned in the contract.

**Step 5: Check for any exclusivity clauses or non-compete requirements**

1. ""Artist grants distributor exclusive digital distribution rights worldwide."" - This is an exclusivity clause that restricts the artist from distributing their music through other channels.

**Step 6: Finally, summarize all artist obligations**

Based on the analysis, the artist's obligations are:

1. Deliver music in a specified format within 30 days before the release date.
2. Grant the distributor exclusive digital distribution rights worldwide.
3. Be responsible for all production costs.
4. Ensure copyright clearances for their music.

contract_3,Distribution Deal,llama3_8b,llama-3.1-8b-instant,chain_of_thought,risks,"Let's analyze the contract step by step to identify potential risks for the artist:

**Step 1: Identify all monetary commitments, financial penalties, and revenue splits**

- The artist retains 70% of streaming revenue after the distributor takes 30%.
- The artist is responsible for all production costs.
- The artist is responsible for copyright clearances.
- There is a minimum sales threshold of 100,000 streams in the first year, failure to meet which may result in termination of the agreement.

**Potential risks:**

- The artist is only retaining 70% of the revenue, which means they are giving up 30% to the distributor.
- The artist is responsible for all production costs, which can be a significant financial burden.
- The artist is also responsible for copyright clearances, which can be time-consuming and costly.

**Step 2: Look for termination clauses - can the artist exit, what are the conditions?**

- The agreement remains in effect for 24 months.
- The distributor may terminate the agreement if the artist fails to meet the minimum sales threshold of 100,000 streams in the first year.

**Potential risks:**

- The artist may be locked into the agreement for 24 months, even if they are not satisfied with the terms.
- The distributor has the power to terminate the agreement if the artist fails to meet the minimum sales threshold, which could be a significant risk for the artist.

**Step 3: Find any one-sided obligations that favor the label/company**

- The artist grants the distributor exclusive digital distribution rights worldwide.
- The artist is responsible for all production costs and copyright clearances.

**Potential risks:**

- The artist is giving up exclusive digital distribution rights worldwide, which means they may not be able to distribute their music through other channels.
- The artist is taking on significant financial and administrative burdens by being responsible for production costs and copyright clearances.

**Step 4: Check for creative control limitations or approval requirements**

- There are no specific limitations or approval requirements mentioned in the contract.

**Potential risks:**

- None identified.

**Step 5: Evaluate liability limitations, indemnifications, and ownership of intellectual property**

- There are no specific liability limitations or indemnifications mentioned in the contract.
- The artist grants the distributor exclusive digital distribution rights worldwide, which implies that the distributor may have some ownership or control over the intellectual property.

**Potential risks:**

- The artist may be liable for any damages or losses incurred by the distributor due to their failure to meet the minimum sales threshold.
- The distributor may have some ownership or control over the intellectual property, which could limit the artist's ability to use or exploit their own work.

**Step 6: Note any restrictive clauses (exclusivity, non-compete, ""360 deals"")**

- The artist grants the distributor exclusive digital distribution rights worldwide, which is a form of exclusivity.
- There is no mention of a non-compete clause or a ""360 deal"".

**Potential risks:**

- The artist is giving up exclusive digital distribution rights worldwide, which means they may not be able to distribute their music through other channels.
- The exclusivity clause may limit the artist's ability to work with other distributors or labels.

contract_3,Distribution Deal,llama3_70b,llama-3.3-70b-versatile,zero_shot,risks,"Based on the Distribution Agreement between Independent Artist Mike Brown and Digital Distributor Corp, the following are at least 3 key risks that could negatively impact the artist:

1. **Termination due to Minimum Sales Threshold**: The agreement states that the distributor may terminate the contract if the artist fails to meet a minimum sales threshold of 100,000 streams in the first year. This poses a significant risk to the artist, as it may be challenging to achieve this threshold, especially if the artist is new or doesn't have a large following. If the contract is terminated, the artist may lose the opportunity to distribute their music through the distributor's channels, which could harm their career and revenue.

2. **Exclusive Digital Distribution Rights**: By granting the distributor exclusive digital distribution rights worldwide, the artist may be limiting their ability to distribute their music through other channels or platforms. This could restrict the artist's creative freedom and flexibility, as well as potentially limiting their revenue streams. If the distributor is not effective in promoting the artist's music or if the artist wants to explore other distribution options, they may be locked into this agreement, which could negatively impact their career.

3. **Responsibility for Production Costs and Copyright Clearances**: The agreement states that the artist is responsible for all production costs and copyright clearances. This poses a significant financial risk to the artist, as production costs can be high, and copyright clearances can be complex and time-consuming. If the artist is not able to secure the necessary clearances or if they incur significant production costs, they may be liable for these expenses, which could put a strain on their finances and impact their ability to create new music.

Additional risks that could negatively impact the artist include:

* **Loss of Creative Control**: By granting the distributor exclusive digital distribution rights, the artist may have limited control over how their music is promoted and distributed.
* **Revenue Share**: The artist only retains 70% of streaming revenue, which means that the distributor takes a significant 30% share. This could impact the artist's revenue and profitability.
* **Governing Law**: The agreement is governed by Texas law, which may not be favorable to the artist if disputes arise.

1. **Looking for words indicating time periods**: The contract mentions ""twenty-four (24) months"" as the period the agreement shall remain in effect. Additionally, it mentions ""first year"" in relation to the minimum sales threshold.

2. **Identifying the starting point (commencement date)**: The contract is dated March 1, 2024, which can be considered the commencement date of the agreement.

3. **Looking for renewal or extension clauses**: There is no mention of renewal or extension clauses in the provided contract. This suggests that the agreement does not automatically renew or extend beyond its initial term unless explicitly stated otherwise, which it is not.

4. **Noting any termination conditions that affect the duration**: The contract states that the distributor may terminate the agreement if the artist fails to meet a minimum sales threshold of 100,000 streams in the first year. This condition can potentially shorten the duration of the agreement if the threshold is not met.

5. **Summarizing the complete term understanding**:

    - It is set to last for 24 months (2 years) from the commencement date, assuming no termination.
    - The duration can be shortened if the artist fails to achieve 100,000 streams in the first year, as this failure gives the distributor the right to terminate the agreement.

1. **Identify all ""shall"", ""must"", or ""agrees to"" statements concerning the artist:**
   - The contract states that the ""Artist must deliver music in specified format within 30 days before release date."" This implies an obligation on the artist to meet a specific deadline and format requirement for their music delivery.
   - The phrase ""Artist retains 70% of streaming revenue"" implies an agreement on the revenue split but does not directly state an obligation. However, it's part of the overall agreement the artist is party to.
   - ""Artist grants distributor exclusive digital distribution rights worldwide"" indicates an agreement to grant rights, which is an obligation to not distribute digitally through other means.
   - ""Artist is responsible for all production costs and copyright clearances"" directly states a financial and legal obligation on the artist.

2. **Look for delivery requirements (music, content, performances):**
   - The contract specifies that the artist must deliver music in a specified format within 30 days before the release date. This is a clear delivery requirement concerning the artist's music.

3. **Identify any creative restrictions or approval requirements:**
   - There are no explicit creative restrictions mentioned in the contract, such as limitations on the type of music the artist can produce or requirements for distributor approval on creative decisions. However, the distributor's right to terminate if a minimum sales threshold is not met could indirectly influence the artist's creative decisions.

4. **Note any marketing or promotional obligations:**
   - The contract does not explicitly mention marketing or promotional obligations on the part of the artist. The focus is on the distribution and revenue split.

5. **Check for any exclusivity clauses or non-compete requirements:**
   - The contract states that the ""Artist grants distributor exclusive digital distribution rights worldwide."" This is an exclusivity clause, meaning the artist cannot distribute their music digitally through other distributors during the term of the agreement.

6. **Finally, summarize all artist obligations:**
   - **Delivery Obligation:** Deliver music in a specified format within 30 days before the release date.
   - **Financial Obligations:** Responsible for all production costs and copyright clearances.
   - **Exclusivity:** Grant exclusive digital distribution rights to the distributor worldwide, preventing the artist from digitally distributing their music through other channels.
   - **Performance Threshold:** While not a direct obligation, the artist must achieve a minimum of 100,000 streams in the first year to avoid termination of the agreement by the distributor.
   - **Compliance with Agreement Terms:** The artist must comply with all terms of the agreement, including adhering to the revenue split and the governance of the agreement by Texas law.

contract_3,Distribution Deal,llama3_70b,llama-3.3-70b-versatile,chain_of_thought,risks,"Let's analyze the contract step by step to identify potential risks for the artist, Mike Brown.

**Step 1: Identify all monetary commitments, financial penalties, and revenue splits**

* The artist retains 70% of streaming revenue, while the distributor takes 30%. This seems like a relatively standard revenue split.
* The artist is responsible for all production costs and copyright clearances, which could be a significant financial burden.
* There is a minimum sales threshold of 100,000 streams in the first year. If the artist fails to meet this threshold, the distributor may terminate the agreement. This could be a financial penalty, as the artist may have already invested time and money into producing and promoting their music.

**Step 2: Look for termination clauses - can the artist exit, what are the conditions?**

* The agreement is for a period of 24 months, which means the artist is locked in for two years.
* The distributor may terminate the agreement if the artist fails to meet the minimum sales threshold of 100,000 streams in the first year. However, there is no mention of the artist's ability to terminate the agreement early. This could be a risk for the artist if they want to exit the agreement before the 24-month period is over.

**Step 3: Find any one-sided obligations that favor the label/company**

* The artist grants the distributor exclusive digital distribution rights worldwide, which means the artist cannot distribute their music digitally through any other channels. This could limit the artist's ability to reach their audience and potentially earn more revenue.
* The artist is responsible for all production costs and copyright clearances, which could be a significant burden. The distributor does not seem to have any significant obligations or responsibilities in this regard.

**Step 4: Check for creative control limitations or approval requirements**

* There is no mention of creative control limitations or approval requirements in the contract. However, the fact that the artist must deliver music in a specified format within 30 days before the release date may imply that the distributor has some level of control over the artist's creative output.

**Step 5: Evaluate liability limitations, indemnifications, and ownership of intellectual property**

* The contract does not mention liability limitations or indemnifications, which could leave the artist vulnerable to lawsuits or other legal claims.
* The contract does not explicitly state who owns the intellectual property rights to the artist's music. However, the fact that the artist retains 70% of streaming revenue suggests that the artist may retain some level of ownership or control over their intellectual property.

**Step 6: Note any restrictive clauses (exclusivity, non-compete, ""360 deals"")**

* The contract includes an exclusivity clause, as the artist grants the distributor exclusive digital distribution rights worldwide. This means the artist cannot distribute their music digitally through any other channels, which could limit their ability to reach their audience and earn revenue.
* There is no mention of a non-compete clause or a ""360 deal,"" which would require the artist to grant the distributor control over other aspects of their career, such as merchandise, touring, or branding.

Overall, the contract seems to favor the distributor, as the artist is responsible for all production costs and copyright clearances, and the distributor has the right to terminate the agreement if the artist fails to meet the minimum sales threshold.

1. **Loss of Control over Distribution Rights**: By granting the distributor exclusive digital distribution rights worldwide, the artist may be limited in their ability to distribute their music through other channels or negotiate better deals in the future. This exclusivity could potentially restrict the artist's creative freedom and flexibility.

2. **Termination Risk due to Minimum Sales Threshold**: The distributor may terminate the agreement if the artist fails to meet the minimum sales threshold of 100,000 streams in the first year. If the artist's music does not achieve this level of success, they risk losing the distribution deal, which could negatively impact their ability to distribute their music and earn revenue.

3. **Financial Liability for Production Costs and Copyright Clearances**: The artist is responsible for all production costs and copyright clearances, which can be a significant financial burden. If the artist is unable to cover these costs or if there are disputes over copyright clearances, it could lead to financial losses or even lawsuits, potentially damaging the artist's reputation and financial stability.

Additional risks could include:

1. **Contract Duration**: The agreement is for 24 months.
   - Risk: A relatively long contract duration may lock the artist into terms that might become unfavorable or limit their ability to adapt to changing circumstances.

2. **Revenue Split**: Artist retains 70% of streaming revenue, while the distributor takes 30%.
   - Risk: The 30% fee taken by the distributor reduces the artist's earnings. Depending on the services provided, this might be considered high.

3. **Delivery Requirement**: Artist must deliver music in a specified format within 30 days before the release date.
   - Risk: Tight deadlines can create pressure and potentially lead to rushed production, which might affect the quality of the music. Failure to meet the deadline could result in delays or penalties.

4. **Exclusive Rights**: Artist grants the distributor exclusive digital distribution rights worldwide.
   - Risk: By granting exclusive rights, the artist is limited in their ability to distribute their music through other channels or negotiate better terms elsewhere during the contract period.

5. **Production Costs and Copyright Clearances**: Artist is responsible for all production costs and copyright clearances.
   - Risk: This places a significant financial burden on the artist. Production costs can be high, and any failure to properly clear copyrights can lead to legal issues and additional costs.

6. **Termination Clause**: Distributor may terminate the agreement if the artist fails to meet a minimum sales threshold of 100,000 streams in the first year.
   - Risk: The high threshold of 100,000 streams within the first year is challenging and poses a significant risk. Failure to meet this threshold gives the distributor the right to terminate the agreement, potentially leaving the artist without a distribution deal and impacting their career momentum.

7. **Governing Law**: The agreement is governed by Texas law.
   - Risk: Depending on the artist's location or preferences, being governed by the laws of a specific jurisdiction (in this case, Texas) might not be ideal, potentially leading to additional legal complexities or costs if disputes arise.

In summary, the risks associated with this contract include:
- A relatively long contract duration that locks the artist into potentially unfavorable terms.
- A significant distribution fee that reduces artist earnings.
- Pressure due to tight delivery deadlines.
- Loss of control over distribution due to exclusive rights granted to the distributor.
- Financial burden due to production costs and copyright clearances being the artist's responsibility.
- The potential for contract termination if a high streaming threshold is not met.
- Potential legal complexities due to the contract being governed by Texas law.

1. **Look for words indicating time periods like ""term"", ""duration"", ""years"", ""months""**:
   - The contract mentions ""a period of twenty-four (24) months,"" directly indicating the duration.
   - It also references ""first year"" in the context of a minimum sales threshold.

2. **Identify the starting point (commencement date) if mentioned**:
   - The contract is ""dated March 1, 2024,"" which serves as the commencement date.

3. **Look for renewal or extension clauses**:
   - There are no explicit renewal or extension clauses mentioned in the contract.

4. **Note any termination conditions that affect the duration**:
   - The distributor may terminate the agreement if the artist fails to meet the minimum sales threshold of 100,000 streams in the ""first year.""
   - This implies that if the threshold isn't met, the distributor has the option to terminate, potentially altering the effective duration.

5. **Summarize the complete term understanding**:
   - The contract is set to last for 24 months from March 1, 2024, unless terminated early by the distributor due to the artist failing to meet the minimum sales threshold of 100,000 streams within the first year (by March 1, 2025).

### Step 1: Identify ""shall"", ""must"", or ""agrees to"" statements concerning the artist

1. The agreement ""shall remain in effect for a period of twenty-four (24) months."" - This concerns the duration of the agreement rather than a specific artist obligation.
2. ""Artist must deliver music in specified format within 30 days before release date."" - This is a clear obligation on the artist to deliver music in a specified format and timeframe.
3. ""Artist grants distributor exclusive digital distribution rights worldwide."" - This implies the artist ""agrees to"" grant exclusive rights, making it an obligation.

### Step 2: Look for delivery requirements (music, content, performances)

1. ""Artist must deliver music in specified format within 30 days before release date."" - This specifies a delivery requirement for the artist's music.

### Step 3: Identify any creative restrictions or approval requirements

1. There's no direct mention of creative restrictions or approval requirements in the given contract. However, the requirement to ""deliver music in specified format"" could imply some level of restriction or specification regarding the format.

### Step 4: Note any marketing or promotional obligations

1. There's no explicit mention of marketing or promotional obligations on the artist. However, the overall structure of the agreement (e.g., the distributor's rights and the revenue split) implies that the artist is expected to produce content that will be distributed and potentially promoted through the distributor.

### Step 5: Check for any exclusivity clauses or non-compete requirements

1. ""Artist grants distributor exclusive digital distribution rights worldwide."" - This is an exclusivity clause, meaning the artist is restricted from granting digital distribution rights to other parties during the term of the agreement.

### Step 6: Finally, summarize all artist obligations

Based on the steps above, the artist's obligations under the contract are:
1. **Deliver music in a specified format within 30 days before the release date.** This is a specific delivery requirement.
2. **Grant exclusive digital distribution rights to the distributor worldwide.** This means the artist cannot distribute their music digitally through other channels during the contract term.
3. **Bear all production costs and copyright clearances.** Although not directly stated with ""shall"", ""must"", or ""agrees to"", it's implied that the artist is responsible for these costs as the contract states ""Artist is responsible for all production costs and copyright clearances.""
4. **Meet the minimum sales threshold of 100,000 streams in the first year** to avoid contract termination by the distributor. While not an obligation per se, failure to meet this threshold could result in termination.

contract_3,Distribution Deal,llama_4_maverick,meta-llama/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct,chain_of_thought,risks,"To analyze the Distribution Agreement between Independent Artist Mike Brown and Digital Distributor Corp, let's break it down step by step according to the given instructions.

### 1. Identify all monetary commitments, financial penalties, and revenue splits

- **Revenue Split**: The artist retains 70% of the streaming revenue, while the distributor takes 30%. This is a clear revenue split.
- **Monetary Commitments**: The artist is responsible for all production costs and copyright clearances. This is a significant monetary commitment as it implies the artist bears all upfront costs associated with producing music and clearing any necessary copyrights.
- **Financial Penalties**: There's a potential financial ""penalty"" in the form of termination if the artist fails to meet the minimum sales threshold of 100,000 streams in the first year. While not a direct financial penalty, it could lead to a loss of the distribution deal, which might be considered a significant consequence.

### 2. Look for termination clauses - can the artist exit, what are the conditions?

- The contract specifies that the distributor may terminate the agreement if the artist fails to meet the minimum sales threshold of 100,000 streams in the first year. This is a one-sided termination clause favoring the distributor.
- There's no explicit mention of the artist's ability to terminate the contract. The duration is fixed at 24 months, suggesting that the artist is committed to this agreement for this period unless there's an implicit or explicit termination clause for the artist, which is not mentioned.

### 3. Find any one-sided obligations that favor the label/company

- The artist is responsible for all production costs and copyright clearances, which is a significant obligation.
- The distributor has the right to terminate the agreement based on a sales threshold, which is a one-sided condition favoring the distributor.
- The artist grants the distributor exclusive digital distribution rights worldwide, which is a significant commitment favoring the distributor.

### 4. Check for creative control limitations or approval requirements

- The contract specifies that the artist must deliver music in a specified format within 30 days before the release date. This implies some level of control or specification by the distributor over the format of the music delivery.
- There's no explicit mention of the distributor having approval rights over the content of the music, but the requirement for the artist to deliver music in a ""specified format"" could imply some level of oversight or specification.

### 5. Evaluate liability limitations, indemnifications, and ownership of intellectual property

- The contract doesn't explicitly mention liability limitations or indemnifications. However, the artist is responsible for copyright clearances, implying the artist might be liable for any copyright infringements.
- The ownership of intellectual property isn't directly addressed, but the artist retains the rights to the music; the distributor is merely granted ""exclusive digital distribution rights."" This suggests the artist maintains ownership, but the exclusivity of the distribution rights is a significant grant to the distributor.

### 6. Note any restrictive clauses (exclusivity, non-compete, ""360 deals"")

- The contract includes an exclusivity clause as it grants the distributor ""exclusive digital distribution rights worldwide."" This is restrictive as it prevents the artist from distributing their music through other digital channels during the contract period.
- There's no explicit mention of a ""360 deal,"" which typically involves the label or distributor taking a percentage of all the artist's revenue streams, not just music sales or streaming. However, the exclusivity for digital distribution is a form of restrictive clause.

### Summary of Risks for the Artist

1. **Financial Risks**: The artist bears all production costs and copyright clearances, and there's a potential for termination if sales thresholds aren't met.
2. **Contractual Obligations**: The artist is locked into a 24-month agreement with limited explicit rights to terminate.
3. **Exclusivity and Restrictive Clauses**: The exclusivity granted to the distributor for digital distribution worldwide could limit the artist's ability to explore other distribution channels.
4. **Potential Lack of Creative Control**: While not explicitly stated, the requirement to deliver music in a ""specified format"" could imply some level of distributor oversight.

Okay, let's see. The user wants me to analyze the artist contract and extract the term or duration of the agreement. They specified to return only the specific term mentioned.

First, I'll read through the contract provided. The key part here is the sentence: ""This agreement shall remain in effect for a period of twenty-four (24) months."" That seems to directly state the term. 

I need to make sure there's no other mention of duration elsewhere. Let me check again. The contract starts with the date March 1, 2024. The term is 24 months. There's a mention of termination if the artist fails to meet sales thresholds, but that's a condition for termination, not the term itself. The rest of the contract talks about revenue splits, delivery deadlines, rights, and governing law, none of which mention the duration beyond the initial 24 months. 

So the term is clearly stated as twenty-four months. The answer should just be that number in the specified format.

Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to identify all the key obligations and responsibilities of the artist from the given contract. First, I need to read through the contract carefully to make sure I don't miss any details.

The contract is a Distribution Agreement between Mike Brown and Digital Distributor Corp, effective March 1, 2024, for 24 months. The artist retains 70% of streaming revenue, and the distributor takes 30%. That's a revenue split, but I don't think that's an obligation for the artist, just a financial arrangement. 

Next, the artist must deliver music in a specified format within 30 days before the release date. That's definitely an obligation. Then, the artist grants exclusive digital distribution rights worldwide. So, the artist can't distribute the music through other platforms during the agreement. 

The artist is responsible for all production costs and copyright clearances. That's another key point. They have to handle the financial and legal aspects of producing the music. 

The distributor can terminate the agreement if the artist fails to meet a minimum sales threshold of 100,000 streams in the first year. Wait, is that an obligation on the artist? It's a condition for termination, so the artist is expected to meet that threshold to avoid termination. So that's an obligation in a way, because not meeting it could lead to the contract being ended. 

The agreement is governed by Texas law, but that's more about jurisdiction than an obligation. 

So, compiling all these points, the artist's obligations are: delivering music in the correct format on time, granting exclusive rights, covering production costs and clearances, and meeting the sales threshold to prevent termination. I need to present these as clear bullet points without including non-obligations like revenue splits or governing law. Let me double-check each part of the contract to ensure I didn't miss anything. Yep, that's all. Now, list them in a concise manner.
</think>

**Artist Obligations:**  
- Deliver music in the specified format **30 days before the release date**.  
- Grant the distributor **exclusive digital distribution rights worldwide** for the duration of the agreement.  
- **Cover all production costs** associated with the music.  
- Ensure **copyright clearances** for all content distributed under this agreement.  
- Meet the **minimum sales threshold of 100,000 streams in the first year** to avoid potential termination by the distributor.  
- Comply with the **24-month term** of the agreement (unless terminated earlier for cause).

contract_3,Distribution Deal,qwen_32b,qwen/qwen3-32b,zero_shot,risks,"<think>
Okay, let's see. The user wants me to identify three key risks for the artist in this distribution agreement. The contract is between Mike Brown and Digital Distributor Corp. Let me start by going through the contract details carefully.

First, the artist retains 70% of streaming revenue, but the distributor takes 30%. That seems standard, but maybe the issue is the split itself? Not sure yet. The artist has to deliver music in a specified format 30 days before release. If they miss that deadline, maybe they can't release on time, which could affect sales. That's a risk.

Then, the artist grants exclusive digital distribution rights worldwide. If the distributor doesn't promote well, the artist can't distribute elsewhere. Exclusivity might limit their options if the distributor isn't effective. That's a risk because they can't use other platforms if this one isn't working.

The artist is responsible for all production costs and copyright clearances. If there's a copyright issue, the artist could face legal problems and financial loss. Also, if production costs are high and the album doesn't sell well, they might not recoup their investment. That's another risk.

The distributor can terminate the agreement if the artist doesn't meet 100,000 streams in the first year. If the artist doesn't meet that, they lose the contract, which could affect their ability to distribute through this distributor. Maybe they can't get another deal if they fail here. That's a termination risk.

Also, the contract is governed by Texas law. If there's a dispute, the artist might have to deal with Texas courts, which might be less favorable if they're not based there. That could add legal complexity and costs.

So, the main risks I can think of are: 1) Exclusivity limiting distribution options if the distributor underperforms. 2) Responsibility for production costs and copyright issues leading to financial loss or legal trouble. 3) Risk of termination for not meeting sales thresholds, which could disrupt distribution and revenue. Maybe the third point is the termination clause. Let me check the contract again. Yes, the distributor can terminate if the artist doesn't hit 100k streams in the first year. That's a significant risk because if they don't meet it, the contract ends, and they lose the distribution deal. Also, the production costs and copyright responsibility are on the artist, so if there's a problem there, they're on the hook. And the exclusivity means they can't use other distributors if this one isn't working. Those three seem like the key risks.
</think>

The contract between Mike Brown and Digital Distributor Corp presents several risks for the artist. Here are **three key risks** that could negatively impact the artist:

---

### **1. Exclusivity and Limited Distribution Options**  
The artist grants the distributor **exclusive digital distribution rights worldwide**, meaning they cannot use other platforms (e.g., Spotify, Apple Music) or alternative distributors during the contract term. If the distributor underperforms (e.g., fails to secure optimal streaming deals, lacks marketing support, or has poor industry connections), the artist is locked into a suboptimal partnership. This exclusivity could stifle the artist’s ability to maximize revenue or reach audiences effectively, especially if the distributor lacks resources or expertise.

---

### **2. Financial and Legal Liability for Production Costs and Copyright Clearances**  
The artist is **solely responsible for all production costs** (e.g., studio fees, mastering, marketing) and **copyright clearances** (e.g., licensing samples or third-party content). If the project underperforms (e.g., due to poor distribution or market conditions), the artist may not recoup their investment. Additionally, if copyright issues arise (e.g., unauthorized use of a sample), the artist could face **legal penalties, lawsuits, or reputational damage**, with no recourse against the distributor.

---

### **3. Risk of Termination for Unmet Sales Thresholds**  
The distributor can **terminate the agreement if the artist fails to achieve 100,000 streams in the first year**. This creates significant pressure on the artist to meet arbitrary sales targets, which may be unrealistic depending on their genre, audience size, or market conditions. Termination would disrupt the distribution deal, potentially leaving the artist without a platform to monetize their work. It also undermines long-term planning, as the artist cannot rely on stability beyond the first year.

---

### Additional Considerations:  
- **Texas Law Jurisdiction**: Disputes will be resolved under Texas law, which may be unfavorable to the artist if they are based elsewhere, increasing legal costs and complexity.  
- **Time Constraints**: Delivering music 30 days before the release date could lead to rushed production or missed deadlines, risking penalties or delayed releases.  

These risks highlight the importance of negotiating terms that balance exclusivity, financial responsibility, and performance expectations to protect the artist’s interests.",3.9923737049102783,,"{'term': np.float64(0.0), 'revenue_split': np.float64(0.25428683524032436), 'delivery_obligation': np.float64(0.22459202675185327), 'rights_granted': np.float64(0.31958610812300636), 'costs_responsibility': np.float64(0.06567058553421985), 'termination_threshold': np.float64(0.2517717197832262)}",0.18598454590543834

Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to analyze the term of the artist contract provided. Let me start by recalling the examples given. In Example 1, the term was straightforward: 2 years. In Example 2, it was 12 months with automatic renewal. The key here is to identify the duration and any conditions for renewal or termination.

Looking at the contract in question, the first thing I notice is the line: ""This agreement shall remain in effect for a period of twenty-four (24) months."" That's a clear initial term of 24 months. Now, I need to check if there's any mention of automatic renewal or other conditions that might extend the term. The contract mentions that the distributor can terminate if the artist fails to meet a minimum sales threshold of 100,000 streams in the first year. However, termination is different from renewal. Termination would end the agreement early, but it doesn't affect the initial term. There's no mention of automatic renewal here, so the term remains 24 months unless terminated earlier. The other parts about revenue split, delivery deadlines, and rights don't affect the term. So the term is 24 months, with a possible early termination if the sales threshold isn't met. I should make sure not to include the termination condition as part of the term unless it's a renewal clause. Since it's a termination clause, the term is still 24 months, but the agreement could end earlier under specific conditions.
</think>

**Term:** 24 months with a potential early termination clause.  

**Analysis:**  
The contract explicitly states the agreement will remain in effect for **24 months** (2 years). However, it includes a **termination condition**: the distributor may terminate the agreement if the artist fails to meet a **minimum sales threshold of 100,000 streams in the first year**. This creates a risk of early termination but does not alter the stated initial term. There is no mention of automatic renewal beyond the 24-month period.  

**Key Points:**  
- **Initial term:** 24 months.  
- **Early termination:** Possible if the artist does not achieve 100,000 streams in the first year.  
- **No automatic renewal** beyond the initial term.  

The term is primarily defined as 24 months, with a performance-based termination condition.",1.8326084613800049,,"{'term': np.float64(0.35738416687707314), 'revenue_split': np.float64(0.00761582755711948), 'delivery_obligation': np.float64(0.007401778540718964), 'rights_granted': np.float64(0.0013365126941190504), 'costs_responsibility': np.float64(0.010025166413211484), 'termination_threshold': np.float64(0.24677306953956532)}",0.10508942027030123

Okay, let's tackle this contract analysis. The user wants me to list the obligations from the given contract between Mike Brown and Digital Distributor Corp. Let me start by reading through the contract carefully.

First, the contract is a Distribution Agreement dated March 1, 2024, lasting 24 months. The key points here are the revenue split, delivery of music, rights granted, responsibilities for costs and clearances, termination conditions, and governing law.

The artist retains 70% of streaming revenue, so the distributor takes 30%. That's a standard split, but maybe not an obligation per se. The obligations are more about what the artist must do. 

Next, the artist must deliver music in a specified format within 30 days before the release date. That's a clear obligation. Then, the artist grants exclusive digital distribution rights worldwide. So that's another obligation to grant those rights.

The artist is responsible for production costs and copyright clearances. That's important because it means they can't pass those costs to the distributor. 

The distributor can terminate the agreement if the artist doesn't meet a minimum sales threshold of 100,000 streams in the first year. That's a condition for termination, which is an obligation on the artist's part to meet that threshold to avoid termination. 

Also, the agreement is governed by Texas law, which is a legal clause but not an obligation. 

Wait, the user's examples included obligations as bullet points. So I need to list each obligation the artist has. Let me go through each part again.

1. Deliver music in specified format within 30 days before release date. That's one obligation.

2. Grant distributor exclusive digital distribution rights worldwide. Another obligation.

3. Responsible for all production costs and copyright clearances. That's a third obligation.

4. Meet minimum sales threshold of 100,000 streams in first year to avoid termination. The contract says the distributor may terminate if the artist fails to meet this, so the artist has an obligation to meet that threshold.

Are there any others? The duration is 24 months, but that's a term, not an obligation. The revenue split is a term too. The governing law is a legal clause. 

So the obligations are the four points I listed. Let me check the examples again. In Example 1, the obligations were the specific actions required. Similarly, here, the obligations are the things the artist must do. The termination condition is a consequence if they don't meet the threshold, so the obligation is to meet that threshold. 

I think that's all. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The contract also mentions the artist must deliver music in a specified format, which is an obligation. The exclusive rights grant is another. Production costs and clearances are third. The sales threshold is the fourth. 

Yes, that's four obligations. Let me structure them as bullet points like the examples.
</think>

**Obligations:**  
- Deliver music in the specified format within 30 days before the release date.  
- Grant the distributor exclusive digital distribution rights worldwide.  
- Cover all production costs and ensure copyright clearances for the music.  
- Meet a minimum sales threshold of 100,000 streams in the first year to avoid termination.  

**Key Notes:**  
- The 70%/30% revenue split and 24-month duration are contractual terms, not obligations.  
- The Texas law governing clause is a jurisdictional provision, not an obligation.  
- The distributor’s right to terminate for non-compliance with the 100,000-stream threshold is a conditional clause tied to the artist’s performance obligation.",1.8848028182983398,,"{'term': np.float64(0.30978721292206074), 'revenue_split': np.float64(0.24426287716860157), 'delivery_obligation': np.float64(0.3379521226846892), 'rights_granted': np.float64(0.32608469667642276), 'costs_responsibility': np.float64(0.04667537044558868), 'termination_threshold': np.float64(0.24064272377416315)}",0.25090083394525436
contract_3,Distribution Deal,qwen_32b,qwen/qwen3-32b,few_shot,risks,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this contract analysis. First, I need to read through the contract details carefully. The user provided an example of how to structure the risks, so I should follow that format.

The contract is a Distribution Agreement between Mike Brown and Digital Distributor Corp. The key points are the 24-month term, 70% revenue share for the artist, delivery of music within 30 days, exclusive distribution rights, artist's responsibility for production costs and copyright clearances, termination for not meeting 100k streams in the first year, and governed by Texas law.

Starting with the revenue split: 70% to the artist, 30% to the distributor. That seems better than the 20% management fee in Example 1, but maybe the user wants to highlight that the distributor is taking a significant cut. However, compared to other distribution deals, 30% might be standard, but it's still a risk because it reduces the artist's earnings.

Next, the delivery requirement: 30 days before release. That's a tight deadline. If Mike can't meet it, maybe there are penalties? The example mentions penalties in Example 2, but here it's not specified. Still, the pressure to deliver on time is a risk, especially if production takes longer than expected.

Exclusive distribution rights mean Mike can't use another distributor. This limits his options if he wants to distribute through other platforms. Similar to the exclusive relationship in Example 1, this restricts his freedom. So that's a risk point.

Production costs and copyright clearances are the artist's responsibility. That's a big one. If Mike has to handle all the costs, he might face financial strain. Also, if there's a copyright issue, he's liable, which could lead to legal problems. This is a significant risk because it shifts the burden to him.

The minimum sales threshold of 100k streams in the first year. If he doesn't meet that, the distributor can terminate the agreement. This creates pressure to perform, and if he fails, he loses the distribution deal. It's a risk because it's a high bar, and streaming numbers can be unpredictable. Also, termination could affect his ability to distribute music elsewhere if the rights are exclusive.

Governed by Texas law. Depending on the artist's location, this might be a risk if Texas law is less favorable to artists. For example, if there's a dispute, the legal process in Texas might be more challenging for Mike if he's not based there.

Putting this all together, the risks would include the revenue split, tight deadlines, exclusive rights limiting options, financial responsibility for production and clearances, performance-based termination, and legal jurisdiction. I need to make sure each risk is clearly stated and relates to the contract terms. Let me check if I missed anything. The contract duration is 24 months, but that's not a risk unless there's a renewal clause or something else. The example contracts had three risks each, so maybe I should aim for three to five here. Let me structure them clearly.
</think>

**Risks:**  
- **Unfavorable revenue split**: Distributor retains 30% of streaming revenue, which may limit the artist’s earnings despite being higher than some standard distribution deals.  
- **Strict delivery deadline**: Artist must deliver music 30 days before release, creating pressure to meet tight timelines and risking penalties or delays if unmet.  
- **Exclusive distribution rights**: Restricts the artist from using other distributors, limiting flexibility to explore alternative platforms or partnerships.  
- **Financial burden on artist**: Artist bears full responsibility for production costs and copyright clearances, exposing them to potential financial loss or legal liability if issues arise.  
- **Performance-based termination**: Agreement can be terminated if the artist fails to achieve 100,000 streams in the first year, creating high-pressure expectations and risking loss of distribution rights for unpredictable streaming outcomes.  
- **Legal jurisdiction risk**: Disputes governed by Texas law may disadvantage the artist if they are not based in Texas or if local laws favor the distributor in conflicts.  

This analysis highlights key vulnerabilities in the contract, emphasizing financial, operational, and legal risks that could impact the artist’s autonomy and success.",2.4442789554595947,,"{'term': np.float64(0.306434189273168), 'revenue_split': np.float64(0.2489373283606502), 'delivery_obligation': np.float64(0.23997982302808074), 'rights_granted': np.float64(0.026230253812268373), 'costs_responsibility': np.float64(0.05620771335183618), 'termination_threshold': np.float64(0.2575677075409903)}",0.1892261692278323
contract_3,Distribution Deal,qwen_32b,qwen/qwen3-32b,chain_of_thought,term_extraction,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this contract analysis step by step. First, I need to figure out the term or duration of the agreement between Mike Brown and Digital Distributor Corp. The user provided a contract, so I'll start by reading through it carefully.

The contract is a Distribution Agreement dated March 1, 2024. The first thing I notice is the line: ""This agreement shall remain in effect for a period of twenty-four (24) months."" That seems straightforward. So the initial term is 24 months. But I should check if there's any mention of renewal or extension. The contract doesn't mention anything about renewing the agreement after the initial term. It just states the duration as 24 months. 

Next, the starting point. The contract is dated March 1, 2024, so that's the commencement date. The term starts on that date and lasts for 24 months. That would take it through February 28 or 29, 2026, depending on the year. Since 2024 is a leap year, February 29 would exist, but the contract doesn't specify the end date beyond the 24-month period. So the end date would be March 1, 2024, plus 24 months, which is March 1, 2026. Wait, but adding 24 months to March 1, 2024, would actually be March 1, 2026. However, the contract says ""remain in effect for a period of twenty-four (24) months,"" so starting from March 1, 2024, the term ends on February 29, 2026, if we count 24 months. Wait, maybe I should check that again. Let me count: March 2024 to March 2026 is 24 months. So if the term is 24 months starting March 1, 2024, the end date would be March 1, 2026. But sometimes contracts end on the day before the anniversary. Hmm, the contract doesn't specify the end date beyond the 24-month period, so it's safe to assume it's from March 1, 2024, to March 1, 2026, unless there's a clause that says otherwise.

Now, looking for renewal or extension clauses. The contract doesn't mention any automatic renewal or extension. There's no language like ""renewable for additional terms"" or ""may be extended upon mutual agreement."" So the initial term is fixed at 24 months with no automatic renewal.

Termination conditions: The contract states that the distributor may terminate the agreement if the artist fails to meet a minimum sales threshold of 100,000 streams in the first year. So if Mike doesn't hit that threshold within the first 12 months, the distributor can terminate the agreement before the 24-month term is up. That's an important point because it means the actual duration could be shorter if the termination condition is met. However, the initial term is still 24 months unless terminated early.

Putting it all together: The agreement has an initial term of 24 months starting March 1, 2024. There's no renewal clause, so it doesn't automatically extend. The distributor has the right to terminate early if the sales threshold isn't met in the first year. So the term is 24 months unless terminated earlier by the distributor for cause. The end date would be March 1, 2026, unless terminated sooner.
</think>

**Step-by-Step Analysis of the Contract Term/Duration:**

1. **Identify Time Period Words:**  
   The contract explicitly states: *""This agreement shall remain in effect for a period of twenty-four (24) months.""* This directly defines the **initial term** as 24 months.

2. **Starting Point (Commencement Date):**  
   The agreement is dated **March 1, 2024**, which is the **commencement date**. The term begins on this date.

3. **Renewal/Extension Clauses:**  
   There is **no mention of automatic renewal** or extension clauses. The contract does not include language like ""renewable for additional terms"" or ""may be extended,"" so the 24-month term is **fixed and non-renewable** unless explicitly agreed upon outside the contract.

4. **Termination Conditions:**  
   The distributor may terminate the agreement **before the 24-month term ends** if the artist fails to meet a **minimum sales threshold of 100,000 streams in the first year**. This creates a **potential early termination** scenario, shortening the duration if the condition is triggered.

5. **Summary of Term/Duration:**  
   - **Initial Term:** 24 months (March 1, 2024, to March 1, 2026).  
   - **Early Termination Risk:** The distributor can terminate the agreement if the artist does not achieve 100,000 streams in the first year.  
   - **No Automatic Renewal:** The term does not extend beyond 24 months unless both parties agree to a new agreement.  

**Final Determination:**  
The contract has a **fixed term of 24 months** starting March 1, 2024, with a **potential early termination** by the distributor if the sales threshold is unmet. There is no provision for automatic renewal.",3.9661569595336914,,"{'term': np.float64(0.36531269744737915), 'revenue_split': np.float64(0.007185184888660061), 'delivery_obligation': np.float64(0.005509827565507543), 'rights_granted': np.float64(0.0014577745454686407), 'costs_responsibility': np.float64(0.008596868083436566), 'termination_threshold': np.float64(0.24159465900520377)}",0.10494283525594261
contract_3,Distribution Deal,qwen_32b,qwen/qwen3-32b,chain_of_thought,obligations,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this contract analysis step by step. The user wants me to identify all the artist's obligations from the given distribution agreement. Let me start by breaking down each part of the contract as outlined in the instructions.

First, I need to look for any ""shall"", ""must"", or ""agrees to"" statements. The contract mentions ""Artist must deliver music in specified format within 30 days before release date."" That's a clear obligation using ""must"". Also, ""Artist grants distributor exclusive digital distribution rights worldwide"" uses ""grants"", which is a form of agreement. So those are two points under the first step.

Next, delivery requirements. The artist has to deliver music in a specific format 30 days before the release. That's a delivery requirement. Are there any others? The contract also says the artist is responsible for production costs and copyright clearances. While that's more about financial and legal responsibilities, maybe it's part of the delivery in terms of ensuring the content is ready for distribution. But the main delivery is the music in the specified format.

Creative restrictions or approval requirements. The contract states that the artist grants exclusive distribution rights, but there's no mention of the distributor having approval over the content. The artist retains creative control unless specified otherwise. So maybe there are no creative restrictions here. The user should check if there's any clause about needing approval for content, but in this case, it doesn't seem to be present.

Marketing or promotional obligations. The contract doesn't mention the artist needing to do any marketing or promotion. The distributor's role is to distribute, and the artist's obligations are about delivery and exclusivity. So no promotional duties here.

Exclusivity clauses or non-compete requirements. The artist grants exclusive digital distribution rights, which means they can't distribute the music through another distributor during the agreement. That's an exclusivity clause. Also, the agreement is for 24 months, so the exclusivity is time-bound. There's no non-compete clause mentioned, just the exclusivity in distribution.

Summarizing all obligations: delivering music in format, exclusive rights, handling production costs and clearances, meeting sales threshold to avoid termination. Wait, the sales threshold is a condition for the distributor to terminate, but is that an obligation of the artist? The user's instructions mention obligations, so maybe the sales threshold is a performance metric that the artist must meet to avoid termination. So the artist is obligated to ensure that the music meets the sales threshold, otherwise the distributor can terminate. But the contract doesn't say the artist has to achieve it; it's a condition for termination. Hmm, maybe that's a bit of a gray area. The user might need to note that the artist's failure to meet the threshold could lead to termination, but it's not an obligation they have to fulfill, just a risk if they don't meet it. So perhaps that's not an obligation but a consequence. The main obligations are the delivery, exclusivity, production costs, and clearances.

Let me double-check each step. The user wants obligations, so things the artist must do. The sales threshold is a condition for termination, not an obligation. So the summary should include the delivery, exclusivity, production costs, and clearances. The exclusivity is a key point here. Also, the contract duration is 24 months, so the exclusivity is for that period. The artist can't distribute elsewhere during that time. That's a non-compete in terms of distribution. So the exclusivity clause is the main non-compete here.

Putting it all together, the artist's obligations are: deliver music in specified format 30 days before release, grant exclusive distribution rights, handle production costs and copyright clearances, and ensure the music meets the sales threshold to avoid termination. Wait, but the sales threshold is a condition for termination, not an obligation. The artist isn't required to achieve it, but if they don't, the distributor can terminate. So maybe that's not an obligation but a risk. The user's instructions say to note any obligations, so maybe the sales threshold isn't an obligation but a consequence. Therefore, the main obligations are the four points: delivery, exclusivity, production costs, and clearances. The sales threshold is a condition for termination, not an obligation. So the summary should list those four.

### Step-by-Step Analysis of Artist Obligations in the Contract  

---

#### **1. ""Shall"", ""Must"", or ""Agrees To"" Statements**  
- **""Artist must deliver music in specified format within 30 days before release date.""**  
- **""Artist grants distributor exclusive digital distribution rights worldwide.""**  

---

#### **2. Delivery Requirements**  
- **Music Delivery**: The artist must deliver music in a **specified format** **30 days before the release date**.  
- **Production Costs**: The artist is responsible for **all production costs** (e.g., recording, mixing, mastering).  
- **Copyright Clearances**: The artist must handle **copyright clearances** for all content (e.g., samples, third-party material).  

---

#### **3. Creative Restrictions or Approval Requirements**  
- **No explicit creative restrictions**: The contract does not mention the distributor having approval rights over the artist’s creative output (e.g., song selection, album artwork, or lyrics).  
- **Exclusive Rights**: The artist grants **exclusive digital distribution rights** to the distributor, but this does not inherently restrict creative control over the content itself.  

---

#### **4. Marketing or Promotional Obligations**  
- **No obligations**: The contract does not require the artist to perform marketing, promotional activities, or social media engagement.  

---

#### **5. Exclusivity Clauses or Non-Compete Requirements**  
- **Exclusive Distribution Rights**: The artist grants the distributor **exclusive digital distribution rights worldwide** for the duration of the 24-month agreement.  
- **Non-Compete Implication**: The exclusivity clause implies the artist **cannot distribute the same content through other platforms** during the agreement term.  

---

#### **6. Summary of Artist Obligations**  
1. **Delivery of Music**:  
   - Deliver music in a **specified format** **30 days before the release date**.  
2. **Exclusive Rights**:

   - While not a direct obligation, the artist risks termination if the distributor deems the music has failed to meet a **minimum sales threshold of 100,000 streams in the first year**.  

---

### Key Takeaways  
- The artist’s primary obligations revolve around **timely delivery of content**, **exclusive rights granting**, and **financial/legal responsibilities**.  
- The **sales threshold** is a **termination condition**, not a direct obligation, but the artist must be aware of its implications.  
- No marketing or creative approval requirements are imposed.",7.297884702682495,,"{'term': np.float64(0.30774821800301927), 'revenue_split': np.float64(0.2405253502866877), 'delivery_obligation': np.float64(0.3379721945674726), 'rights_granted': np.float64(0.335266556702619), 'costs_responsibility': np.float64(0.054450129051182315), 'termination_threshold': np.float64(0.22711023979349854)}",0.2505121147340799
contract_3,Distribution Deal,qwen_32b,qwen/qwen3-32b,chain_of_thought,risks,"<think>
Okay, let's start analyzing this contract step by step as per the user's request. First, I need to break down each of the six points they mentioned and check the contract for relevant clauses.

Starting with monetary commitments and revenue splits. The contract states that the artist retains 70% of streaming revenue after the distributor takes 30%. That seems straightforward, but I should note if there are any hidden fees or additional costs the artist might have to cover. The artist is responsible for production costs and copyright clearances, which are their own expenses. So, the 70% is net revenue, but the artist has to front the production costs. That could be a risk if the production costs are high and the revenue doesn't cover them.

Next, termination clauses. The distributor can terminate the agreement if the artist doesn't meet a minimum sales threshold of 100,000 streams in the first year. That's a performance-based termination clause. The artist might not have control over the streams, especially if the distributor isn't promoting the music effectively. Also, the contract duration is 24 months, but if terminated early, the artist might lose the remaining term. The user should check if there's a notice period or any conditions for the artist to terminate, but the contract doesn't mention that. So the artist can't exit unless the distributor terminates, which is conditional on sales.

Looking for one-sided obligations. The artist has to deliver music in a specified format within 30 days before release. That's a deadline they must meet. The distributor has the exclusive right to distribute, but the artist is responsible for all production costs and clearances. The distributor's main obligation is to distribute, but they can terminate if sales are low. The artist has no such power to terminate unless the distributor breaches, which isn't specified here. So the obligations seem more on the artist's side.

Creative control limitations. The contract mentions the artist grants exclusive distribution rights, but there's no mention of the distributor having approval rights over the content. However, the artist must deliver in a specified format, which might involve some creative input from the distributor. But unless there's a clause requiring the distributor's approval on the content itself, maybe that's not an issue. The user should check if the format requirements are too restrictive, but the contract doesn't specify that.

Liability and IP ownership. The artist grants exclusive digital distribution rights, so the distributor has the right to distribute, but who owns the IP? The contract doesn't say the distributor owns the IP, so the artist likely retains ownership. However, the exclusive rights might mean the distributor can't distribute for others, but the artist can't distribute themselves. The liability part: the contract doesn't mention indemnification, so if there's a copyright infringement, who's liable? The artist is responsible for clearances, so if they fail, they might be liable. The distributor's liability is probably limited unless they breach their part.

Restrictive clauses: The agreement is exclusive, meaning the artist can't distribute through other services. There's a non-compete if the distributor terminates, but the contract doesn't specify a non-compete period. The 360 deal isn't mentioned here, so it's just a distribution agreement. The exclusivity is a restrictive clause because the artist can't use other distributors. Also, the termination based on sales threshold is a restrictive condition that could end the contract early if the artist doesn't meet it, which might not be fair if the distributor isn't doing enough to promote.

Putting it all together, the main risks are the performance-based termination, the artist's responsibility for production costs and clearances, the exclusivity, and the lack of termination rights for the artist. The revenue split is 70-30, which is decent, but the artist has to cover all upfront costs. The contract is governed by Texas law, which might be favorable to the distributor if there's a dispute. The artist should consider negotiating better termination terms, maybe a lower sales threshold or a way to exit if the distributor isn't performing. Also, ensuring that they can use other distributors if the contract is terminated.
</think>

Let’s analyze the contract step by step to identify risks for the artist (Mike Brown):

---

### **1. Monetary Commitments, Financial Penalties, and Revenue Splits**  
- **Revenue Split**:  
  - Artist retains **70% of streaming revenue** after the distributor takes 30%.  
  - **Risk**: The 70% is net revenue, but the artist is responsible for **production costs and copyright clearances** upfront. If production costs are high, the artist may struggle to profit even with decent streaming numbers.  
- **Financial Penalties**:  
  - No explicit penalties for the artist, but the distributor can terminate the contract if the artist fails to meet a **minimum sales threshold of 100,000 streams in the first year**. This creates pressure to deliver results without clear support from the distributor.  

---

### **2. Termination Clauses**  
- **Distributor’s Termination Rights**:  
  - The distributor can terminate the agreement **unilaterally** if the artist fails to meet the 100,000-stream threshold in the first year.  
  - **Risk**: This is a one-sided performance clause. The artist has no control over external factors (e.g., market trends, distributor promotion) that could affect stream counts.  
- **Artist’s Termination Rights**:  
  - The contract does not specify any termination rights for the artist. The artist is **locked into the 24-month term** unless the distributor terminates.  

---

### **3. One-Sided Obligations Favoring the Distributor**  
- **Artist’s Obligations**:  
  - Must deliver music in a **specified format within 30 days before the release date**.  
  - Responsible for **all production costs and copyright clearances**.  
- **Distributor’s Obligations**:  
  - Only obligated to distribute the music. No mention of marketing, promotion, or support to help the artist meet the 100,000-stream threshold.  
- **Risk**: The artist bears all costs and risks (production, legal compliance), while the distributor’s only risk is losing the 30% revenue share if the artist fails.  

---

### **4. Creative Control Limitations**  
- **Exclusive Distribution Rights**:  
  - The artist grants the distributor **exclusive digital distribution rights worldwide**. This means the artist **cannot distribute music through other platforms** during the contract term.  
- **Approval Requirements**:  
  - No mention of the distributor needing approval for content (e.g., song selection, artwork), but the artist must deliver music in a **specified format**, which could limit creative freedom.  
- **Risk**: The exclusivity clause restricts the artist’s ability to explore other distribution channels or partnerships.

### **5. Liability, Indemnification, and IP Ownership**  
- **Liability**:  
  - The artist is responsible for **copyright clearances**. If the distributor faces legal action due to unlicensed samples or content, the artist may be liable.  
- **Indemnification**:  
  - No indemnification clause is mentioned. The artist has no protection if the distributor breaches the contract (e.g., fails to distribute properly).  
- **IP Ownership**:  
  - The artist **retains ownership** of the intellectual property (since the distributor only receives distribution rights).  
- **Risk**: The lack of indemnification and liability clauses leaves the artist vulnerable to legal or financial consequences if the distributor acts negligently.  

---

### **6. Restrictive Clauses**  
- **Exclusivity**:  
  - The artist cannot distribute music through other platforms during the 24-month term.  
- **Non-Compete**:  
  - No explicit non-compete clause, but the exclusivity requirement effectively restricts the artist from working with competitors.  
- **Performance-Based Termination**:  
  - The 100,000-stream threshold is a restrictive condition. If the distributor fails to promote the music adequately, the artist could lose the contract unfairly.  
- **Governing Law**:  
  - The contract is governed by **Texas law**, which may favor the distributor in disputes (e.g., if the distributor is based in Texas).  

---

### **Key Risks Summary**  
1. **Unilateral Termination**: The distributor can end the contract if the artist fails to meet a subjective sales threshold, with no recourse for the artist.  
2. **Financial Burden**: The artist covers all production costs and legal clearances, with no guarantee of returns.  
3. **Exclusivity Restrictions**: The artist is locked into one distributor, limiting flexibility and potential revenue streams.  
4. **Lack of Support**: The distributor has no obligation to promote or market the music, yet can terminate the contract if the artist fails to meet sales targets.  
5. **Liability Exposure**: The artist is solely responsible for copyright compliance, with no indemnification from the distributor.  

---

### **Recommendations for the Artist**  
- **Negotiate a Lower Sales Threshold**: Adjust the 100,000-stream requirement to a more realistic or flexible target.  
- **Add Termination Rights**: Include clauses allowing the artist to exit if the distributor fails to meet promotional obligations.  
- **Clarify Marketing Support**: Require the distributor to provide marketing or promotion in exchange for the exclusive rights.  
- **Include Indemnification**: Ensure the distributor covers legal costs if they breach the",12.747121334075928,,"{'term': np.float64(0.30287632801694236), 'revenue_split': np.float64(0.2623582229025671), 'delivery_obligation': np.float64(0.22546183681112625), 'rights_granted': np.float64(0.31412034372067216), 'costs_responsibility': np.float64(0.05211181912140673), 'termination_threshold': np.float64(0.24213483444655398)}",0.23317723083654474

| # | Risk / Liability | Why it matters for the artist | Potential impact |
|---|------------------|------------------------------|------------------|
| **1. Exclusive‑distribution lock‑in** | The artist grants **exclusive worldwide digital distribution rights** to the distributor for the full 24‑month term. | The artist cannot place the same recordings on any other platform (e.g., direct‑to‑fan services, alternative aggregators, or self‑release) without breaching the contract. | • If the distributor under‑performs (poor placement, weak marketing, delayed releases) the artist is stuck with a sub‑optimal partner for two years.<br>• Missed opportunities to negotiate better deals later or to test emerging platforms (e.g., TikTok‑first releases). |
| **2. Revenue‑share structure & hidden costs** | The contract states the artist “retains 70 % of streaming revenue after distributor takes 30 %,” but it does **not define** what “streaming revenue” includes or whether the 30 % is taken **before or after platform fees, taxes, or other deductions**. | Ambiguities can allow the distributor to deduct additional fees (e.g., “administrative fees,” “payment‑processing fees,” “currency conversion fees”) before calculating the 30 % cut, effectively reducing the artist’s net take. | • The artist may receive far less than the advertised 70 %.<br>• Lack of audit rights makes it difficult to verify the numbers. |
| **3. Termination trigger tied to a sales threshold** | The distributor can terminate the agreement **if the artist fails to reach 100,000 streams in the first year**. | The threshold is **outside the artist’s direct control** (it depends on the distributor’s marketing, playlist placement, and platform algorithms). | • Early termination would leave the artist without a distribution channel mid‑project, forcing a scramble to re‑upload the masters, re‑clear rights, and re‑negotiate new deals.<br>• The artist may also be liable for any “re‑delivery” costs or penalties stipulated in the termination clause. |
| **4. Full responsibility for production & clearance costs** | The artist must cover **all production expenses and copyright clearances** (samples, mechanical licenses, sync clearances, etc.). | No cost‑sharing or reimbursement from the distributor is provided, even though the distributor benefits from the sales. | • Unexpected clearance fees can erode the 70 % share.<br>• If a clearance issue is missed, the artist could face infringement claims, statutory damages, and removal of the offending track from all platforms. |
| **5. Governing law – Texas** | The agreement is governed by **Texas law**. | If the artist resides in another state (or country), they may be forced to litigate in Texas, incurring travel, attorney, and venue‑selection costs. | • Increased legal expenses and logistical hurdles in enforcing rights or defending against claims. |
| **6. Delivery deadline with no cure period** | The artist must deliver the final masters **30 days before the release date**; the contract does not specify a grace period or remedies for late delivery. | Any delay (e.g., mastering revisions, last‑minute sample clearance) could be deemed a breach, giving the distributor the right to terminate or withhold royalties. | • Loss of release schedule, promotional momentum, and potential revenue. |

### Summary of the three most critical risks

1. **Exclusive worldwide rights for 24 months** – limits the artist’s flexibility and can trap them with an under‑performing distributor.  
2. **Unclear revenue‑share calculations & lack of audit rights** – the artist may receive less than the promised 70 % and have little recourse to verify payments.  
3. **Termination based on a sales threshold the artist cannot fully control** – creates a high‑risk “kill‑switch” that could leave the artist without distribution and expose them to additional costs.

### Practical steps the artist should consider

| Action | Reason |
|--------|--------|
| **Negotiate a non‑exclusive or limited‑term clause** (e.g., 12 months with renewal only on mutual consent). | Preserves flexibility to switch distributors if performance is unsatisfactory. |
| **Add a detailed revenue definition and audit clause** (e.g., “streaming revenue = gross receipts from all digital platforms before any platform fees; artist may audit accounts annually at own expense, distributor reimburses reasonable costs”). | Guarantees transparency and protects the 70 % share. |
| **Replace the hard sales‑threshold termination with a “material breach” clause** or a “performance review” that allows the artist to cure deficiencies (e.g., additional marketing spend) before termination. | Reduces the risk of abrupt termination and gives the artist a chance to remedy low‑stream numbers. |
| **Seek a cost‑share or reimbursement provision for clearance fees** or at least a cap on the artist’s liability for undisclosed third‑party claims. | Limits unexpected financial exposure. |
| **Include a venue‑selection clause** (e.g., “any dispute shall be resolved in the artist’s home county/state”) or a mediation step before litigation. | Lowers the burden of defending a claim in a distant jurisdiction. |
| **Add a grace period for delivery** (e.g., “artist may request a reasonable extension up to 10 days with written notice”) and define consequences for late delivery (e.g., reduced royalty rate rather than termination). | Provides a safety net for unforeseen production delays. |

| # | Risk | Why it matters / Potential impact | Typical mitigation / negotiation tip |
|---|------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| 1 | **30 % distribution commission** | A third of all streaming revenue goes to the distributor, leaving the artist with only 70 % of gross receipts. Over time this can significantly erode net earnings, especially on low‑margin streams (e.g., ad‑supported platforms). | • Request a tiered commission (e.g., 25 % after the first $10 k of revenue). <br>• Ask for a “break‑even” clause that reduces the percentage once the artist recoups production costs. |
| 2 | **Exclusive worldwide digital rights** | The distributor becomes the sole entity that can place the music on any digital service globally. This blocks the artist from using other aggregators, direct‑to‑fan platforms, or niche services that might offer better rates or promotional support. | • Limit exclusivity to a specific set of platforms (e.g., major streaming services) and retain the right to self‑distribute on others (Bandcamp, SoundCloud, etc.). <br>• Add a “non‑exclusive” carve‑out for promotional compilations or sync licensing. |
| 3 | **Fixed 24‑month term with no early‑exit provision** | The artist is locked into the relationship for two years even if the distributor under‑performs, changes its business model, or the artist’s career direction shifts. | • Insert a mutual “termination for convenience” clause (e.g., 60‑day written notice). <br>• Include a performance‑based trigger (e.g., if the distributor fails to achieve a minimum number of placements or marketing deliverables). |
| 4 | **Termination if sales < 100,000 streams in Year 1** | The distributor can unilaterally end the agreement if the artist does not hit a relatively low but still significant streaming threshold. This creates a “use‑or‑lose” pressure and may leave the artist without a distribution channel mid‑career. | • Raise the threshold or make it a “reasonable effort” standard rather than a hard number. <br>• Require the distributor to provide a written sales report and an opportunity to cure the shortfall before termination. |
| 5 | **Artist bears all production & copyright‑clearance costs** | All recording, mixing, mastering, artwork, and especially sample or cover‑song clearances are the artist’s financial responsibility. Any mistake (e.g., uncleared sample) could lead to DMCA takedowns, legal claims, or loss of revenue. | • Add an indemnification clause where the distributor will defend the artist against claims arising from the distributor’s own platform‑related errors. <br>• Request a “clearance assistance” provision or a modest budget contribution from the distributor. |
| 6 | **No audit or accounting rights specified** | Without a right to audit the distributor’s books, the artist cannot verify that the 70 % share is being calculated correctly, especially for complex revenue streams (e.g., YouTube ad revenue, mechanical royalties, sync fees). | • Insert a standard audit clause (e.g., artist may audit annually, at their own cost, unless a discrepancy > 5 % is found, in which case the distributor pays the audit). |
| 7 | **Governing law: Texas** | Texas law may be less favorable to artists in certain areas (e.g., limitation‑of‑liability statutes, interpretation of “exclusive” rights). If a dispute arises, the artist may have to litigate in a jurisdiction far from their home base, increasing costs. | • Negotiate a neutral governing law (e.g., New York or California) or at least a venue clause that allows disputes to be heard in the artist’s home county. |
| 8 | **No explicit marketing or promotional obligations** | The agreement is silent on what, if any, marketing, playlist pitching, or promotional services the distributor will provide. The artist may assume the distributor will actively promote releases, but the distributor could simply upload the files and collect the 30 % cut. | • Add a “marketing services” schedule (e.g., minimum number of playlist pitches, social‑media posts, or ad spend). <br>• Tie a portion of the commission to measurable promotional activities. |
| 9 | **No reversion clause for rights after termination** | If the agreement ends (whether by expiration or termination), the contract does not state that the exclusive distribution rights revert automatically to the artist. The distributor could continue to exploit the recordings without paying royalties. | • Include a clear reversion clause: “Upon termination, all exclusive distribution rights revert to the artist, and the distributor must cease all exploitation within 30 days.” |
| 10 | **No limitation of liability / indemnity provisions** | The contract does not limit the distributor’s liability for breach (e.g., failure to pay royalties on time) nor does it require the distributor to indemnify the artist against third‑party claims arising from the distributor’s actions (e.g., wrongful takedowns). | • Add a mutual limitation of liability (e.g., liability capped at the total amount paid under the agreement) and an indemnification clause protecting the artist from distributor‑caused claims. |
| 11 | **No force‑majeure or hardship clause** | Unexpected events (pandemic, platform outages, natural disasters) could affect streaming numbers or the ability to deliver files on time, yet the contract provides no safety net. | • Insert a standard force‑majeure clause that suspends performance obligations during events beyond either party’s control. |
| 12 | **No confidentiality or data‑privacy provisions** | The distributor will receive the artist’s unreleased masters, metadata, and possibly personal data. Without confidentiality language, the distributor could share or misuse this information. | • Add a confidentiality clause covering all pre‑release material and a data‑privacy clause that complies with applicable laws (e.g., GDPR, CCPA). |
| 13 | **No dispute‑resolution mechanism** | The agreement jumps straight to litigation under Texas law. This can be costly and time‑consuming. | • Propose a tiered dispute‑resolution process: first mediation, then binding arbitration (e.g., under the American Arbitration Association). |

---

### Bottom‑Line Takeaway

- **Financial Exposure:** 30 % commission + exclusive rights = limited upside and reduced flexibility.  
- **Control & Flexibility:** Exclusivity and a hard‑stop termination clause lock the artist into a single channel and could leave them stranded if sales targets aren’t met.  
- **Operational Risks:** All production and clearance costs fall on the artist, and there’s no safety net for missed deadlines, platform failures, or unexpected legal claims.  
- **Transparency & Protection:** Lack of audit rights, reversion language, and liability limits leaves the artist vulnerable to under‑payment or continued exploitation after termination.

**Recommended next steps:**  
1. **Negotiate the points above** (especially commission structure, exclusivity carve‑outs, termination triggers, audit rights, and reversion of rights).  
2. **Seek a qualified entertainment attorney** to draft or revise the agreement, ensuring the language reflects the negotiated changes and complies with both Texas law and the artist’s home‑state protections.  
3. **Run a cost‑benefit analysis** comparing this distributor’s reach and services against alternative aggregators that may offer lower fees or non‑exclusive terms.

| 1 | **Time‑period language** (e.g., “term”, “duration”, “years”, “months”) | “This agreement shall remain in effect for a period of **twenty‑four (24) months**.” | The fixed term is 24 months. |
| 2 | **Commencement (starting point)** | The agreement is dated **March 1, 2024** and no other “effective date” is specified. | The contract begins on **March 1, 2024** (the date of the agreement). |
| 3 | **Renewal / extension clauses** | No language about automatic renewal, option to renew, or extension is present. | **No renewal provision** – the term ends automatically after the 24‑month period unless the parties execute a new agreement. |
| 4 | **Termination conditions that affect duration** | “Distributor may terminate agreement if artist fails to meet minimum sales threshold of 100,000 streams in first year.” | The distributor has a **conditional early‑termination right**. If the artist does not reach 100,000 streams by the end of the first 12 months (i.e., by **February 29, 2025**), the distributor can end the contract before the 24‑month expiry. No other termination rights (e.g., for breach, convenience, etc.) are mentioned. |
| 5 | **Summary of the complete term understanding** | • **Start date:** March 1, 2024  <br>• **Fixed term:** 24 months → scheduled end date **February 28, 2026** (or February 29, 2026 in a leap‑year calendar). <br>• **Early termination:** Distributor may end the agreement anytime during the first year if the artist does not achieve 100,000 streams. <br>• **No renewal/extension:** The contract does not automatically continue after February 2026; any continuation would require a new written agreement. | |

### Final Summary

- **Effective period:** March 1, 2024 – February 28/29, 2026 (24 months).  
- **Early‑termination trigger:** Failure to reach 100,000 streams within the first 12 months gives the distributor the right to terminate the agreement before the scheduled end date.  
- **No renewal clause:** The agreement expires automatically at the end of the 24‑month term unless the parties expressly agree to a new contract.  

Thus, the **primary term** is a two‑year (24‑month) fixed period, beginning on the contract date, subject to possible early termination in the first year based on the sales‑threshold condition.

|---|------------------------|------------------|------------------------------------|
| 1 | “**This agreement shall remain in effect for a period of twenty‑four (24) months.**” | *shall* (but refers to the agreement, not a specific action by the Artist) | Imposes the overall term of the contract; the Artist is bound for the full 24‑month period. |
| 2 | “**Artist must deliver music in specified format within 30 days before release date.**” | *must* | **Delivery obligation** – the Artist must provide the final audio files (and any required metadata) in the format the Distributor specifies, and must do so at least 30 days prior to each release. |
| 3 | “**Artist grants Distributor exclusive digital distribution rights worldwide.**” | *grants* (an affirmative commitment, functionally equivalent to “agrees to”) | **Exclusivity obligation** – the Artist agrees that no other party may receive digital distribution of the works anywhere in the world during the term. |
| 4 | “**Artist is responsible for all production costs and copyright clearances.**” | Declarative (no “shall/must/agrees to” but a clear responsibility) | **Financial & legal obligation** – the Artist must pay for recording, mixing, mastering, artwork, etc., and must ensure that all samples, compositions, and recordings are properly cleared of third‑party rights before delivery. |
| 5 | “**Distributor may terminate agreement if Artist fails to meet minimum sales threshold of 100,000 streams in first year.**” | Conditional (not a direct obligation, but a performance trigger) | Implies the Artist must strive to achieve at least 100,000 streams in the first 12 months to avoid termination. |

---

### 1. Identify all “shall”, “must”, or “agrees to” statements concerning the Artist
- **Must**: “Artist must deliver music in specified format within 30 days before release date.”
- **Grants** (functionally an agreement): “Artist grants Distributor exclusive digital distribution rights worldwide.”
- **Is responsible for** (implicit “must”): “Artist is responsible for all production costs and copyright clearances.”
- The “shall” clause about the agreement’s term applies to the Artist indirectly (it binds the Artist for 24 months).

---

### 2. Delivery Requirements (music, content, performances)
- **Format & Timing**: Deliver the final master recordings (and any required metadata) in the Distributor‑specified digital format **no later than 30 days before each release date**.
- **Scope**: Delivery covers all tracks that the Artist wishes the Distributor to make available digitally during the 24‑month term.

---

### 3. Creative Restrictions or Approval Requirements
- The contract **does not contain** any explicit creative‑restriction language (e.g., “Artist shall not alter lyrics,” “Distributor must approve mixes,” etc.).  
- The only limitation is the **exclusivity** of digital distribution (see below), which indirectly restricts the Artist from licensing the same recordings to another digital distributor.

---

### 4. Marketing or Promotional Obligations
- **No marketing/promotional duties** are stated for the Artist.  
- The Distributor’s marketing responsibilities (if any) are not described in the excerpt, and the Artist is not required to undertake any specific promotional activities.

---

### 5. Exclusivity / Non‑Compete Requirements
- **Exclusive Digital Distribution**: “Artist grants Distributor exclusive digital distribution rights worldwide.”  
  - This prevents the Artist from using any other digital distributor for the same recordings anywhere in the world for the duration of the agreement (24 months).  
- **No broader non‑compete**: The contract does **not** forbid the Artist from performing live, selling physical copies, or engaging in non‑digital music activities.

---

### 6. Summary of All Artist Obligations

| Obligation | Details |
|------------|---------|
| **Term Commitment** | Remain bound to the agreement for **24 months**. |
| **Delivery** | Provide each track in the Distributor‑specified digital format **≥30 days before its release**. |
| **Exclusivity** | Grant **exclusive worldwide digital distribution** to the Distributor; cannot license the same recordings to any other digital platform during the term. |
| **Financial Responsibility** | Pay **all production costs** (recording, mixing, mastering, artwork, etc.). |
| **Legal Clearance** | Secure **all copyright clearances** (samples, compositions, performances) before delivery. |
| **Performance Threshold** | Achieve **≥100,000 streams in the first year** to avoid giving the Distributor a termination right. |

## Step‑by‑Step Risk Analysis of the Distribution Agreement

| # | Issue | What the contract says | Potential risk / downside for the artist (Mike Brown) | Why it matters / possible mitigation |
|---|-------|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| 1 | **Monetary commitments, financial penalties, revenue splits** | • Artist keeps **70 %** of streaming revenue; distributor keeps **30 %**.<br>• Artist is **responsible for all production costs** and **copyright clearances**. | • The 30 % take‑rate may be higher than industry‑standard “net‑revenue” splits for independent distributors (many charge 10‑15 %).<br>• All production costs (recording, mixing, mastering, artwork, metadata, etc.) come out of the artist’s pocket **before** the 70 % split is calculated, reducing net cash flow.<br>• No explicit cap on “production costs” – could include expensive studio time, session musicians, sample clearances, etc. | • Compare the 30 % fee with other distributors (e.g., DistroKid, TuneCore, CD Baby).<br>• Negotiate a lower percentage or a tiered fee (e.g., lower % after a certain revenue threshold).<br>• Clarify which costs are “production costs” and consider budgeting them separately. |
| 2 | **Termination clauses** | • Distributor may terminate **if the artist fails to meet a minimum sales threshold of 100,000 streams in the first year**. | • The threshold is relatively low for a popular release but could be unattainable for a new/independent act, giving the distributor a unilateral right to end the deal.<br>• No termination right for the artist is mentioned (i.e., the artist cannot exit early without penalty). | • Ask for a **mutual termination clause** (e.g., either party may terminate with 30‑60 days’ written notice).<br>• Request a **grace period** or a “cure” provision (artist gets a chance to remedy low streams before termination). |
| 3 | **One‑sided obligations favoring the distributor** | • Artist must **deliver music in a specified format within 30 days before the release date** (no flexibility).<br>• Artist bears **all production and copyright clearance costs** while the distributor receives a fixed 30 % of revenue. | • The distributor gets a revenue share **without sharing any cost burden**.<br>• The 30‑day delivery window may be tight for artists who need extra time for mastering, artwork, or last‑minute changes, potentially leading to missed release dates and breach claims. | • Negotiate a **reasonable delivery window** (e.g., 45–60 days) and a **clear process for extensions**.<br>• Seek a clause that allows the distributor to **assist** (or share cost) with copyright clearances if they are the party granting the distribution rights. |
| 4 | **Creative control limitations / approval requirements** | • The agreement grants the distributor **exclusive digital distribution rights worldwide** but does **not** state any approval rights over the content. | • While the contract does not explicitly limit creative control, the **exclusivity** means the artist cannot place the same recordings with any other digital platform or service, even if the distributor refuses to release a track for content reasons. | • Add a **content‑approval clause** that requires the distributor to act in good faith and not unreasonably withhold release.<br>• Include a **reversion clause**: if the distributor fails to release within a set time (e.g., 90 days), rights revert to the artist. |
| 5 | **Liability limitations, indemnifications, IP ownership** | • Artist is **responsible for all copyright clearances** (implies indemnification of the distributor for any infringement).<br>• No explicit language about **ownership of the master recordings** or **licensing scope** beyond “exclusive digital distribution rights worldwide”. | • If a third party sues for copyright infringement, the artist will likely bear all legal costs and damages, even though the distributor benefits from the revenue.<br>• “Exclusive digital distribution rights” may be interpreted broadly, potentially limiting the artist’s ability to license the same masters for physical distribution, sync, or other uses unless expressly reserved. | • Insert a **mutual indemnification**: the distributor also indemnifies the artist for claims arising from the distributor’s own actions (e.g., mis‑labeling, platform violations).<br>• Clarify **ownership**: “Artist retains all ownership of the master recordings; distributor receives a non‑transferable, exclusive license to distribute digitally for the term.”<br>• Reserve **non‑digital rights** (physical, sync, TV, film, etc.) for the artist. |
| 6 | **Restrictive clauses (exclusivity, non‑compete, “360” deals)** | • **Exclusive digital distribution rights worldwide** for 24 months.<br>• No mention of a broader “360” revenue share (e.g., merch, touring, publishing). | • Exclusivity prevents the artist from using any other digital distributor (e.g., Bandcamp, direct upload to YouTube Music) during the term, even if the distributor under‑performs.<br>• The contract does **not** impose a non‑compete on other aspects of the artist’s business (which is good), but the digital‑only exclusivity can still be restrictive. | • Negotiate a **non‑exclusive** or **limited‑exclusivity** clause (e.g., exclusive only for certain territories or platforms).<br>• Add a **performance clause**: exclusivity remains only if the distributor meets agreed‑upon service levels (e.g., minimum number of releases per quarter, marketing support). |
| 7 | **Term length** | • Fixed **24‑month** term. | • A two‑year lock‑in may be excessive if the distributor’s performance is poor; the artist cannot switch to a better service without breaching the contract. | • Request a **shorter initial term** (e.g., 12 months) with an automatic renewal option.<br>• Include a **termination‑for‑convenience** clause after the first 12 months (e.g., 30‑day notice). |
| 8 | **Governing law** | • **Texas law** governs the agreement. | • If the artist resides outside Texas, any dispute will be litigated under Texas statutes, potentially requiring travel and higher legal costs. | • Consider adding a **forum‑selection clause** that allows disputes to be resolved in the artist’s home state or via arbitration. |
| 9 | **Missing / ambiguous provisions** | • No **audit rights** for the artist to verify streaming data and revenue calculations.<br>• No **marketing or promotional obligations** from the distributor.<br>• No **force‑majeure** or **termination for cause** language for the artist. | • Without audit rights, the artist must trust the distributor’s reporting, which could lead to under‑payment.<br>• Lack of promotional duties may result in the distributor doing little to promote the releases, affecting the 100,000‑stream threshold. | • Add an **audit clause** (e.g., artist may audit distributor’s books once per year at distributor’s expense if a discrepancy >5 %).<br>• Include a **minimum marketing effort** (e.g., placement on playlists, email newsletters).<br>• Insert a **termination‑for‑cause** clause that allows the artist to exit if the distributor materially breaches (e.g., fails to upload within agreed timeline). |

## Summary of Key Risks for Mike Brown

1. **High revenue split (30 % to distributor) with no cost sharing** – may erode net earnings, especially for a new artist.
2. **Unilateral termination right for the distributor** based on a sales threshold that the artist cannot control, with no reciprocal exit right.
3. **Full financial responsibility for production and copyright clearance** while the distributor enjoys a revenue share.
4. **Broad exclusive digital‑distribution grant** limits the artist’s ability to use alternative platforms or services during the 24‑month term.
5. **Potential liability exposure** for copyright infringement without a reciprocal indemnity from the distributor.
6. **Lack of audit, marketing, and performance guarantees** leaves the artist dependent on the distributor’s goodwill.
7. **Governing law and jurisdiction** may impose additional costs if a dispute arises outside Texas.

## Practical Recommendations (Negotiation Points)

| Issue | Suggested Amendment / Language |
|-------|---------------------------------|
| **Revenue split** | Reduce distributor’s take to 15‑20 % or adopt a tiered model (e.g., 30 % until $5,000 earned, then 15 %). |
| **Termination** | Add a **mutual termination** clause (30‑",4.659233808517456,,"{'term': np.float64(0.3075923996021281), 'revenue_split': np.float64(0.26494686551327673), 'delivery_obligation': np.float64(0.23273261772525278), 'rights_granted': np.float64(0.3305713135064713), 'costs_responsibility': np.float64(0.06862391939127443), 'termination_threshold': np.float64(0.24970890104226634)}",0.24236266946344498
